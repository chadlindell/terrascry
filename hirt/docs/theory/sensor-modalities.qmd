## Overview

HIRT's modular architecture supports multiple sensing modalities beyond the core MIT-3D and ERT-Lite channels. This section documents supported and potential sensor types, their physical principles, and integration considerations.

## Sensor Maturity Framework

Each sensor modality is classified by maturity level:

| Level | Label | Definition |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **S** | **Supported Now** | Fully validated, documented in build guide |
| **R** | **Recommended Extension** | Tested principle, straightforward integration |
| **F** | **Future Exploration** | Promising concept, requires development |

## Supported Now (S)

### MIT-3D: Magneto-Inductive Tomography

**Maturity:** Supported Now

**Physical Principle:** Low-frequency electromagnetic induction generates eddy currents in conductive materials. The secondary magnetic field from these currents is detected by receiver coils.

**Detects:**

- Metallic objects (ferrous and non-ferrous)
- Highly conductive soil zones
- Saline groundwater

**Key Parameters:**

| Parameter | Specification | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| Frequency range | 2-50 kHz **(Target)** | Trade-off: depth vs. resolution |
| TX coil current | 10 mA RMS **(Target)** | Signal strength vs. power consumption |
| Coil configuration | Coaxial, horizontal | Directional sensitivity |

**Unique Capability:** Detects aluminum and other non-ferrous metals invisible to magnetometers.

**Limitations:**

- Limited penetration in highly conductive soils
- Sensitive to electromagnetic interference
- Requires careful shielding and calibration

### ERT-Lite: Electrical Resistivity Tomography

**Maturity:** Supported Now

**Physical Principle:** Small DC or low-frequency AC currents injected through electrodes create potential distributions that depend on subsurface resistivity structure.

**Detects:**

- Soil disturbance (compaction, fill boundaries)
- Moisture content variations
- Voids and cavities
- Decomposition products

**Key Parameters:**

| Parameter | Specification | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| Injection current | 0.5-2.0 mA **(Target)** | Safety, contact resistance tolerance |
| Electrode configuration | Ring electrodes | Omni-directional sensitivity |
| Measurement type | Potential vs. reference | Simplified hardware |

**Unique Capability:** Maps soil disturbance boundaries with excellent geometric fidelity.

**Limitations:**

- Requires good electrode-soil contact
- Sensitive to contact resistance variations
- Resolution depends on electrode spacing

## Recommended Extensions (R)

These modalities are technically straightforward and provide significant value. Implementation is recommended for comprehensive surveys.

### Accelerometer/Tilt Sensor

**Maturity:** Recommended Extension

```{python}
#| label: fig-tilt-error
#| fig-cap: "Tilt error propagation in probe deployment. A 5-degree tilt at 3 m depth produces 26 cm of lateral positional error at the probe tip, displacing sensor rings from their assumed vertical positions and distorting inversion results."
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 6

import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '..') if '..' not in sys.path else None
from diagrams.sensor_modalities import create_tilt_error_diagram
from PIL import Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

buf = create_tilt_error_diagram()
img = Image.open(buf)
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.imshow(img)
plt.axis('off')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Technical Necessity for Accurate Inversion

Probe tilt significantly affects tomographic inversion accuracy. Without borehole deviation data, reconstruction assumes vertical probe alignment. In soft soils, probes can deviate several degrees, causing geometric distortion in results.

**Impact of uncorrected tilt:**

- 5 deg tilt at 3 m depth = 26 cm positional error at tip **(Modeled)**
- Sensor ring positions displaced from assumed locations
- Inversion results geometrically distorted

Accelerometer integration is recommended as a **standard feature**, not optional enhancement.
:::

**Physical Principle:** MEMS accelerometer measures gravitational vector, yielding tilt angle in two axes.

**Detects:**

- Probe inclination from vertical
- Rotation around vertical axis (with magnetometer)

**Implementation:**

| Aspect | Specification |
|--------|---------------|
| Sensor type | 3-axis MEMS accelerometer |
| Example part | ADXL345, MPU-6050 |
| Resolution | 0.1° or better |
| Cost | <$5 per probe **(Target)** |
| Integration | I²C bus, shares probe MCU |

**Data Use:**

1. Record tilt at each depth during insertion
2. Build probe trajectory (deviation survey)
3. Use actual electrode positions in inversion mesh
4. Report maximum deviation in survey metadata

**Calibration:** Factory calibration adequate. Verify zero reading with probe in calibration fixture.

### Temperature Array

**Maturity:** Recommended Extension

**Physical Principle:** Thermistors or digital temperature sensors measure soil temperature at multiple depths.

**Detects:**

- Thermal gradients from decomposition
- Seasonal temperature variations
- Contamination heat signatures
- Groundwater flow indicators

**Forensic Application:** Decomposition generates heat. Temperature anomalies can indicate burial sites, particularly in early stages (weeks to months).

**Implementation:**

| Aspect | Specification |
|--------|---------------|
| Sensor type | Digital 1-Wire (DS18B20) |
| Sensors per probe | 3-6 (one per segment) |
| Resolution | 0.0625°C |
| Accuracy | ±0.5°C |
| Cost | <$2 per sensor |
| Integration | 1-Wire bus, single data line |

**Data Use:**

1. Build vertical temperature profile
2. Compare profiles between probes
3. Identify thermal anomalies relative to background
4. Time-series monitoring for dynamic processes

**Calibration:** Factory calibrated. Verify with ice-water bath before field deployment.

**Limitations:**

- Requires thermal equilibration time (10-30 minutes after insertion)
- Surface temperature dominates shallow readings
- Decomposition signature fades with time

## Future Exploration (F)

These modalities show promise but require additional development or have operational constraints.

### Moisture/Capacitance

**Maturity:** Future Exploration (deferred per multi-model consensus)

**Physical Principle:** Soil dielectric constant varies with moisture content. Capacitance between electrodes changes accordingly.

**Detects:**

- Volumetric water content
- Saturation zones
- Soil type (indirectly via dielectric response)

::: {.callout-note}
## Why Deferred

Multi-model consensus identified concerns:

1. **Calibration complexity:** Response depends on soil type, not just moisture
2. **Installation geometry sensitivity:** Small changes in electrode contact affect readings
3. **Interpretation overlap:** May confuse interpretation vs. ERT without careful documentation
4. **Limited forensic relevance:** ERT already provides moisture-related information

Recommend focusing on temperature + accelerometer before adding moisture sensors.
:::

**If Implemented:**

| Aspect | Specification |
|--------|---------------|
| Sensor type | Capacitive moisture probe |
| Measurement | Dielectric constant or capacitance |
| Calibration | Site-specific required |

### pH Sensor

**Maturity:** Future Exploration

**Physical Principle:** Ion-selective electrode measures hydrogen ion activity.

**Detects:**

- Soil acidification from decomposition
- Contamination plumes
- Natural soil chemistry variations

**Forensic Application:** Decomposition releases organic acids, potentially detectable as pH anomalies.

**Challenges:**

- **Electrode fouling:** Soil particles coat sensing element
- **Drift:** pH electrodes require frequent recalibration
- **Response time:** Equilibration takes minutes
- **Maintenance:** Not suitable for long-term deployment

**Status:** Potentially useful for forensic applications, but operational constraints significant.

### Dissolved Oxygen

**Maturity:** Future Exploration

**Physical Principle:** Electrochemical or optical sensor measures dissolved oxygen (O2) in pore water.

**Detects:**

- Anaerobic decomposition zones
- Reducing conditions
- Contamination effects

**Challenges:**

- Requires liquid contact (saturated soils only)
- Sensor degradation in soil environment
- High maintenance requirements

### Methane/Gas Sensors

**Maturity:** Future Exploration

**Physical Principle:** Electrochemical or catalytic sensors detect methane and other decomposition gases.

**Detects:**

- Active decomposition (burial sites)
- Landfill gas migration
- Natural gas seepage

**Challenges:**

- Sensor sensitivity in soil environment
- Gas migration pathways complex
- False positives from natural sources

**Potential:** Significant forensic value if technical challenges resolved.

### Self-Potential (SP)

**Maturity:** Future Exploration

**Physical Principle:** Natural electrical potentials arise from electrochemical, streaming, and thermoelectric effects in soil.

**Detects:**

- Groundwater flow
- Redox boundaries
- Contamination plumes

**Implementation:** Passive measurement using existing ERT electrodes—no additional hardware required.

**Status:** Low-cost to implement but interpretation complex. May be useful for contamination studies.

### Pressure/Depth

**Maturity:** Future Exploration

**Physical Principle:** Hydrostatic pressure increases with depth below water table.

**Detects:**

- Water table depth
- Pressure variations in saturated zone
- Depth verification

**Implementation:**

| Aspect | Specification |
|--------|---------------|
| Sensor type | Piezoresistive pressure transducer |
| Range | 0-50 kPa (0-5 m water column) |
| Resolution | 0.1 kPa |

**Limited Value:** Primarily useful in saturated soils for depth verification.

## Multi-Modal Fusion

### Combining Modalities

When multiple sensors are deployed, fusion improves interpretation confidence:

| Combination | Enhanced Detection |
|-------------|-------------------|
| MIT + ERT | Metal in disturbed soil (forensic) |
| MIT + ERT + Temp | Active decomposition with metal artifacts |
| ERT + Temp | Burial without metal (environmental) |
| All + Accel | Geometrically accurate 3D reconstruction |

### Fusion Principles

1. **Each modality provides independent information** - Don't weight redundantly
2. **Anomaly correlation increases confidence** - Co-located signals more likely real
3. **Single-modality anomalies require explanation** - Why didn't others detect it?
4. **Time-series adds dimension** - Dynamic processes reveal themselves

### Joint Inversion

```{python}
#| label: fig-multimodal-fusion
#| fig-cap: "Multi-modal sensor fusion architecture. Independent measurements from MIT-3D, ERT-Lite, accelerometer, and temperature sensors flow through preprocessing into joint inversion, producing a unified 3D subsurface model with confidence estimates."
#| fig-width: 11
#| fig-height: 5

import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '..') if '..' not in sys.path else None
from diagrams.sensor_modalities import create_multimodal_fusion_diagram
from PIL import Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

buf = create_multimodal_fusion_diagram()
img = Image.open(buf)
plt.figure(figsize=(11, 5))
plt.imshow(img)
plt.axis('off')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Advanced processing can incorporate multiple modalities simultaneously:

- **Structural coupling:** Require consistent boundaries across modalities
- **Petrophysical constraints:** Relate electrical properties to physical state
- **Bayesian frameworks:** Combine probabilities from each measurement type

Software: pyGIMLi supports joint inversion of ERT + seismic + other modalities.

## Integration Considerations

### Electrical

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| Bus bandwidth | Prioritize MIT/ERT; sample auxiliary slower |
| Power budget | Sleep low-priority sensors between readings |
| Crosstalk | Temporal separation, shielding |
| Connector pins | M12 connectors support 8 pins; allocate carefully |

### Mechanical

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| Sensor placement | Avoid interference with primary electrodes |
| Water ingress | IP67 rating for all sensors |
| Shock/vibration | MEMS sensors handle insertion loads |

### Data Management

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| File format | Extend CSV format with sensor columns |
| Synchronization | Timestamp all readings |
| Calibration tracking | Registry includes cal dates per sensor type |

## Implementation Priority

Based on multi-model consensus:

### Phase 1: Accelerometer + Temperature

**Rationale:** Accelerometer is technically necessary for accurate inversion. Temperature provides high forensic value with minimal complexity.

**Effort:** ~2 weeks integration, ~$10/probe additional cost **(Target)**

### Phase 2: Validate Core Sensors

**Rationale:** Ensure MIT-3D and ERT-Lite meet specifications before expanding modality set.

**Effort:** Per validation protocol in [Build Guide: Validation](../build-guide/validation.qmd)

### Phase 3: Evaluate Moisture/SP

**Rationale:** After Phase 1 sensors validated, evaluate whether moisture or SP add sufficient value to justify complexity.

**Effort:** Research spike, 2-4 weeks

### Deferred: pH, DO, Gas

**Rationale:** Operational constraints too significant for current development phase. Monitor technology advances.

## Summary

| Modality | Status | Priority | Cost Impact |
|----------|--------|----------|-------------|
| MIT-3D | Supported | Core | Included |
| ERT-Lite | Supported | Core | Included |
| Accelerometer | Recommended | Phase 1 | +$5/probe **(Target)** |

| SP | Future | Phase 3 | Minimal (uses ERT) |
| pH | Future | Deferred | +$30/probe **(Target)** |
| Gas | Future | Deferred | +$50/probe **(Target)** |

The modular probe architecture enables incremental sensor additions. Start with core channels plus accelerometer/temperature, then expand based on application requirements and validation results.
