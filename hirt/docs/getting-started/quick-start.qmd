## Overview

This quick start guide walks you through your first HIRT survey, from equipment check to data collection. For detailed procedures, see the [Field Guide](../field-guide/deployment.qmd).

## Before You Begin

Ensure you have:

- [ ] Complete HIRT probe set (minimum 4 probes for basic survey)
- [ ] Zone hub and cables
- [ ] Data acquisition unit (laptop or dedicated controller)
- [ ] Pilot rod for hole preparation
- [ ] Soft mallet or hand auger
- [ ] Measuring tape and grid markers
- [ ] Field notebook or recording forms

## Safety First

Review [Safety Requirements](safety.qmd) before any field work. At UXO-suspected sites, EOD clearance is mandatory before probe insertion.

## Step 1: Site Assessment (15-30 minutes)

1. **Survey the area** for obstacles, utilities, and access constraints
2. **Mark grid positions** using tape measure and markers
3. **Document conditions** including soil type, moisture, and vegetation
4. **Photograph the site** before any disturbance

## Step 2: Grid Layout

Standard configurations:

| Grid | Probe Count | Coverage | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|----------|
| 2×2 | 4 | Small area (4 m²) | Single target localization |
| 3×3 | 9 | Medium area (16 m²) | Standard investigation |
| 4×4 | 16 | Large area (36 m²) | Comprehensive survey |

Choose probe spacing based on required resolution:

- **1.0 m spacing:** High resolution, small features
- **1.5 m spacing:** Standard balance of resolution and coverage
- **2.0 m spacing:** Rapid reconnaissance, large features

## Step 3: Probe Insertion (5-10 minutes per probe)

1. **Create pilot hole** using auger or pilot rod
   - Target diameter: 12-14 mm (slightly larger than probe)
   - Target depth: Match probe length (typically 1.5-3.0 m)

2. **Insert probe** by hand
   - Maintain vertical orientation
   - Note any obstructions (record actual depth achieved)

3. **Document position**
   - Record X, Y coordinates from grid origin
   - Record actual insertion depth (z_tip_m)
   - Note any offset from ideal position

4. **Connect cables** to zone hub
   - Verify secure connection at both ends
   - Route cables to avoid trip hazards

## Step 4: System Initialization (5 minutes)

1. **Power on** the zone hub and data acquisition unit
2. **Run self-test** to verify all probes respond
3. **Check connection quality** (all probes should show green status)
4. **Record baseline** ambient readings

## Step 5: Data Acquisition (15-45 minutes)

1. **Start measurement cycle**
   - MIT sweep: 2 kHz --> 10 kHz --> 50 kHz
   - ERT injection: Standard pattern

2. **Monitor acquisition**
   - Watch for error indicators
   - Note any unusual readings

3. **Quality check**
   - Verify reciprocity (A to B should approximately equal B to A)
   - Check for drift between first and last measurements

4. **Record metadata**
   - Start/end times
   - Weather conditions
   - Personnel present

## Step 6: Data Export and Backup

1. **Export CSV files** for MIT and ERT data
2. **Copy to backup media** (SD card, USB drive)
3. **Verify file integrity** (open and check record counts)
4. **Complete field notes** while details are fresh

## Step 7: Probe Extraction

1. **Disconnect cables** from zone hub
2. **Extract probes** by pulling straight up
3. **Clean probes** and inspect for damage
4. **Fill holes** if site protocol requires
5. **Restore site** to original condition

## Quick Reference: Typical Workflow

| Phase | Duration | Key Actions |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Setup | 30-60 min | Grid layout, probe insertion |
| Acquisition | 15-45 min | MIT + ERT measurement cycles |
| QA/QC | 10-15 min | Reciprocity check, backup |
| Extraction | 20-40 min | Probe removal, site restoration |
| **Total** | **1.5-3 hours** | For 4×4 grid (16 probes) |

## Next Steps

After your first survey:

1. **Review data quality** using the [Interpretation Guide](../field-guide/interpretation.qmd)
2. **Process data** with inversion software (see [Theory: Inversion](../theory/inversion.qmd))
3. **Document findings** for reporting

## Common Issues

| Problem | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------|
| Probe won't insert | Use auger to clear obstruction, don't force |
| Connection error | Clean connectors, check cable routing |
| Noisy data | Move away from power lines, pause for passing vehicles |
| Poor reciprocity | Check electrode contact, may need conductive gel |
