The design philosophy prioritizes minimal ground disturbance while maintaining robust measurement capability.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Hardware Documentation Reference\n\nCAD files, manufacturing guides, and detailed drawings are maintained in the hardware documentation:\n\n- **CAD Files:** `/hardware/cad/` - OpenSCAD source files and STL exports\n- **Manufacturing Guide:** `/hardware/cad/docs/manufacturing-guide.md` - Printing settings and post-processing\n- **Probe Assembly:** `/hardware/schematics/mechanical/probe-assembly.md` - Detailed assembly drawings\n- **Rod Specifications:** `/hardware/schematics/mechanical/rod-specifications.md` - Material and dimensional specifications\n- **ERT Ring Mounting:** `/hardware/schematics/mechanical/er-ring-mounting.md` - Electrode installation details\n\nSee `/hardware/cad/QUICKSTART.md` for getting started with the CAD files.\n:::\n\n## Design Philosophy {#sec-mech-design-philosophy}\n\n**\"Archaeologist brain first, engineer brain second\"** - This guiding principle shapes every aspect of the HIRT mechanical design. The goal is to create the smallest possible hole while retaining enough physics (coil area, electrode contact) for quality signals. The constraint leads to many thin, gentle holes rather than few large ones, resulting in approximately 10x less disturbance than conventional designs.\n\n## Core Design Principles {#sec-core-principles}\n\n- **No big electronics at the tip:** PCBs, ADCs, MCUs stay at surface. Only passive components downhole.\n- **Probes are mostly passive:** Downhole contains only coils and electrodes plus thin wiring. All \"smart\" electronics reside in junction box above ground.\n- **Rod diameter standard: 16mm OD (Target):** Robust hiking pole standard allowing strong M12 threads. Hole size of 18-20mm (Target) is much less destructive than traditional 50mm.\n\n::: {.cell fig-height='10' fig-width='8' execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Probe assembly exploded view showing the modular construction with M12x1.75 (Manufacturer spec) threaded connections.

A 16mm (Target) rod requires only an 18-20mm (Target) hole, with cross-sectional area of approximately 2.5-3.1 cm^2^ (Modeled) ($\\pi \\times 1.0^2$ cm). At 3m depth, this creates only 0.75-0.93 liters (Modeled) of displacement per hole. In contrast, traditional 25mm rods requiring 50mm holes produce cross-sectional area of approximately 19.6 cm^2^ (Modeled) ($\\pi \\times 2.5^2$ cm), displacing approximately 5.9 liters (Modeled) per hole at 3m depth. This represents a **6-7x reduction** (Modeled) in soil disturbance volume with the HIRT micro-probe design.\n\n::: {.cell fig-height='5' fig-width='10' execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Soil disturbance comparison between HIRT micro-probe (16mm) (Target) and traditional probe (25mm).

The rod must be non-conductive to avoid interference with electromagnetic measurements, strong enough to withstand insertion forces, and durable for repeated field use. Fiberglass (G10) emerges as the preferred material due to its combination of high strength, non-conductivity, RF transparency, and moderate cost.\n\n::: {.cell fig-height='6' fig-width='10' execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Material selection guide for probe rod construction.
