## 7. HYBRID APPROACHES

### 7.1 Water Jet + Push

**Principle:**
Water jet pre-cuts/loosens soil immediately ahead of probe tip, which then advances with static push.

**Advantages:**
- Reduces push force dramatically
- Works in harder soils
- No percussion required

**Implementation:**
- Small water jet nozzle at probe tip
- Low-pressure water assist (not high-pressure cutting)
- Static push follows jetting

**UXO Safety: SAFE**
- No impact forces
- Hydraulic erosion only

---

### 7.2 Pre-Drill + Push

**Principle:**
Create pilot hole using safe method (auger, water jet), then push probe into pre-formed hole.

**Advantages:**
- Separates hole creation from probe installation
- Can use different tools for each phase
- Reduces forces on probe

**Implementation:**
- Phase 1: Create 20-30mm pilot hole
- Phase 2: Insert smaller diameter probe

**UXO Safety: SAFE**
- If pre-drill method is safe
- Push phase is always safe

---

### 7.3 Air-Assist + Push

**Principle:**
Inject low-pressure air to reduce soil friction, combined with static push.

**Advantages:**
- Air lubricates soil-probe interface
- Reduces friction forces
- No water required

**Implementation:**
- Air channels in probe
- Low-pressure air (1-3 bar)
- Static push advancement

**UXO Safety: CAUTION**
- Air pressure effects on ordnance unknown
- Likely safe at low pressures

---

### 7.4 Electro-Osmosis + Push

**Principle:**
Use electrical current to dewater clay soil ahead of probe, reducing penetration resistance.

**Advantages:**
- Very effective in clay soils
- No mechanical energy input to soil
- Can work remotely

**Implementation:**
- Electrodes around probe path
- DC current applied
- Water migrates away from path
- Static push into softened soil

**UXO Safety: CAUTION**
- Electrical effects on ordnance require assessment
- No mechanical energy to soil

---
