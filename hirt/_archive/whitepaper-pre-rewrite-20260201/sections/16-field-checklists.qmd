- [ ] Probe registry updated
- [ ] Site maps/plans available
- [ ] Previous survey data (if applicable)

## 16.2 On-Site Checklist

### Site Setup

- [ ] Establish control area (background scan location)
- [ ] Lay out section grid
- [ ] Record coordinates (GPS/total station)
- [ ] Document site conditions (soil, moisture, weather)
- [ ] Mark probe positions with flags

### Probe Deployment

- [ ] Insert probes systematically
- [ ] Verify depths & IDs match records
- [ ] Connect Probes to Zone Boxes
- [ ] Connect Zone Boxes to Central Hub via Trunk Cables
- [ ] Verify Trunk Cable connectors are tight/screwed in
- [ ] Run diagnostic continuity scan from Hub

### Data Collection

- [ ] Run background scan (control area)
- [ ] Run MIT sweep (all TX; multi-freq)
    - [ ] Verify all frequencies measured
    - [ ] Check for saturation or errors
- [ ] Run ERT patterns (2-4 baselines; flip polarity)
    - [ ] Verify current injection working
    - [ ] Check voltage readings reasonable
- [ ] QC repeats (5-10% of pairs)
    - [ ] Verify reciprocity (A->B approx B->A)
    - [ ] Check consistency

### Quality Control

- [ ] Monitor data quality in real-time
- [ ] Note any anomalies or issues
- [ ] Document any disturbances
- [ ] Verify time synchronization
- [ ] Check for ground loops or noise

### Section Completion

- [ ] All measurements completed
- [ ] Data backed up (if possible on-site)
- [ ] Extract probes carefully
- [ ] Move to next section (keep overlap if possible)
- [ ] Update field log

## 16.3 Post-Deployment Checklist

### Data Management

- [ ] Back up CSVs to secure storage
- [ ] Photo log of the grid (if taken)
- [ ] Quick sanity plots (amp/phase vs distance)
- [ ] Verify data completeness
- [ ] Organize files by section/date

### Equipment Care

- [ ] Decontaminate/inspect probes
- [ ] Note any repairs needed
- [ ] Clean connectors and cables
- [ ] Check for damage
- [ ] Store equipment properly

### Post-Survey Documentation

- [ ] Complete field notes
- [ ] Update probe registry with any changes
- [ ] Document any issues encountered
- [ ] Note lessons learned
- [ ] Prepare preliminary report (if needed)

### Follow-Up Actions

- [ ] Review data quality
- [ ] Identify any missing measurements
- [ ] Plan next steps (additional sections, processing)
- [ ] Schedule equipment maintenance
- [ ] Update procedures based on experience

## 16.4 Emergency Procedures

In the event of an emergency, use these checklists to ensure proper response and documentation. Safety is the top priority in all situations.

### Safety Incidents

::: {.callout-warning}
- [ ] Stop work immediately if unsafe conditions
- [ ] Evacuate if necessary
- [ ] Contact emergency services
- [ ] Document incident
- [ ] Report to site supervisor
:::

### Equipment Failure

::: {.callout-caution}
- [ ] Isolate failed component
- [ ] Use spare if available
- [ ] Document failure for repair
- [ ] Continue with remaining probes if possible
- [ ] Adjust survey plan if needed
:::

### Data Loss Response

::: {.callout-caution}
- [ ] Attempt recovery if possible
- [ ] Document what was lost
- [ ] Re-measure if critical
- [ ] Improve backup procedures
- [ ] Learn from incident
:::

## 16.5 UXO Site Safety Visual

For humanitarian demining or UXO-sensitive sites, the following checklist provides critical safety requirements that must be completed before operations begin.

::: {.callout-important}
## UXO Site Safety Checklist

**Before ANY field operations at UXO-sensitive sites:**

- [ ] EOD clearance certificate obtained
- [ ] Safety briefing completed for all team members
- [ ] Designated safe zones marked
- [ ] Emergency evacuation routes identified
- [ ] Communication protocols established
- [ ] Personal protective equipment verified
- [ ] First aid capabilities confirmed on-site
:::
