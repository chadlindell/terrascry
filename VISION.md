# HIRT Vision

## What is HIRT?

**Hybrid Inductive-Resistivity Tomography** - A dual-channel subsurface imaging system that combines electromagnetic induction (MIT-3D) and electrical resistivity (ERT-Lite) for true 3D tomographic imaging.

## Why HIRT Exists

Current subsurface investigation tools fall into two categories:
1. **Surface-based methods** (GPR, magnetometry) - Fast but limited depth resolution
2. **Borehole methods** (logging, crosshole) - High resolution but expensive, proprietary

HIRT fills the gap: **affordable, open-source, high-resolution 3D imaging** using insertable probes in crosshole geometry.

## Primary Applications

1. **Filled bomb crater investigation** - UXO, human remains, forensic evidence
2. **Woodland burial detection** - Clandestine graves in forested areas
3. **Swamp/marsh recovery** - Aircraft crash sites, submerged evidence

## Non-Negotiables

- **Open source** - All designs, code, and documentation publicly available
- **Reproducible** - Anyone with basic skills can build a working system
- **Scientifically rigorous** - Grounded in physics, validated by testing
- **Field-practical** - Usable by investigators, not just researchers

## Success Criteria

A successful HIRT system:
1. Detects metallic objects (including aluminum) to 3m depth
2. Maps soil disturbance patterns indicating burial/excavation
3. Costs under $4,000 for complete field-ready system
4. Can be assembled by a competent technician in under 40 hours
5. Operates reliably in field conditions (rain, mud, temperature variation)

## Design Philosophy

**Simplicity over features** - A system that works reliably beats one with more capabilities that fails in the field.

**Modularity** - Components can be replaced, upgraded, or repaired independently.

**Documentation as product** - The whitepaper is as important as the hardware. An undocumented system is an unusable system.

## Current Phase

**Phase 1: Documentation & Design** (Active)
- Complete technical whitepaper
- Validated hardware designs
- Tested assembly procedures

**Phase 2: Prototype Validation** (Planned)
- Build reference prototype
- Field testing
- Iterate based on results

**Phase 3: Community Release** (Future)
- Public release of all materials
- Community feedback integration
- Training materials
