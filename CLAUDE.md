# HIRT Project Context

HIRT (Hybrid Inductive-Resistivity Tomography) is a dual-channel subsurface imaging system for archaeology, forensics, and environmental applications.

## Quick Reference

### RIPER Workflow
Use `/riper:strict` to enable mode tracking. Available modes:
- `/riper:research` - Information gathering (read-only)
- `/riper:innovate` - Brainstorming approaches
- `/riper:plan` - Create specifications (saved to memory bank)
- `/riper:execute` - Implement approved plans
- `/riper:review` - Validate implementation

### Memory Bank
- `/memory:save` - Save context to `.claude/memory-bank/`
- `/memory:recall` - Retrieve saved context
- `/memory:list` - List all memories

### Visualization
- `/visualize:scan` - Find all visual placeholders (read-only)
- `/visualize:expand` - Convert placeholders to diagram code

### Key Commands
- Render whitepaper: `cd whitepaper && quarto render`
- Preview whitepaper: `cd whitepaper && quarto preview`
- Export to LaTeX: `cd whitepaper && quarto render --to latex`
- Export STL: `openscad -o output.stl input.scad`

## Writing Style Guide

### Philosophy
The whitepaper should read like a peer-reviewed journal article that happens to include complete build instructions. Prioritize **narrative flow over enumeration**. When you find yourself writing a list of lists, stop and restructure as prose with transitions. Lists are appropriate for:
- Bill of materials and specifications
- Step-by-step procedures where sequence matters
- Quick reference tables

Everything else should flow as interconnected paragraphs that build understanding progressively.

### Audience
Primary readers are technically sophisticated academics, forensic investigators, and archaeological researchers. Assume familiarity with basic physics and engineering concepts but not specialized geophysics. The writing should be:
- **Rigorous**: Claims supported by equations, measurements, or citations
- **Accessible**: Complex concepts introduced with context before diving into detail
- **Practical**: Theory always connected to implementation decisions

### Voice and Tone
- Active voice preferred ("The coil generates..." not "A field is generated by...")
- First person plural for design decisions ("We selected..." not "It was decided...")
- Present tense for describing how the system works
- Past tense for describing the development process or experiments

### Terminology
Maintain consistency throughout:
- **MIT-3D**: The inductive channel (not "EMI", "metal detector", or "inductive sensor")
- **ERT-Lite**: The resistivity channel (not "galvanic", "DC resistivity")
- **Crosshole**: The measurement geometry (not "borehole-to-borehole")

#### Component Terminology
- **Probe**: The complete insertable sensor assembly (sensors + electronics + housing)
- **Rod segment**: Individual fiberglass tube sections that stack to form probe structure
- **Pilot rod**: Metal tool used to create insertion hole (distinct from sensor probe)
- **Survey stake**: Temporary marker for grid positioning (not the sensor probe)

#### Unit Formatting
- **Resistance**: Use "M-ohm" (megohm), "k-ohm" (kilohm), or "ohms" (not Ω symbols)
- **Inductance**: Use "mH" (millihenries) consistently
- **Spacing**: Follow SI convention with space between value and unit (e.g., "16 mm", "2 kHz")

### Visual-First Writing
Complex concepts deserve rich visuals. When writing about something that would benefit from a diagram, schematic, or illustration, insert a visual placeholder block:

```markdown
::: {.visual-placeholder}
**Figure Concept**: [short title]

[Detailed description of what the visual should show, including:
- Key elements and their relationships
- Annotations or callouts needed
- Scale or proportion requirements
- Color coding or visual hierarchy
- What understanding this should convey]

**Type**: [diagram | schematic | photo | chart | cross-section | exploded-view]
:::
```

These placeholders serve as specifications for a visualization agent to expand into actual Python diagram code. Write the description richly enough that someone could draw it without additional context.

### Section Structure
Each major section should:
1. Open with context (why this matters, how it connects to previous sections)
2. Develop the core content with narrative progression
3. Include visuals at decision points or complex concepts
4. Close with implications for the next topic or practical takeaways

Avoid the pattern of: heading, bullet list, heading, bullet list. Instead: heading, introductory paragraph, developed content with embedded specifics, transitional conclusion.
