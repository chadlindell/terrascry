## Planned Content

### Ring Specifications
- **Material:** Stainless steel or copper
- **Width:** 10–12 mm
- **Thickness:** 0.5–1 mm
- **Diameter:** Match rod OD
- **Quantity:** 2–3 rings per probe

### Mounting Positions
- **Standard:** 0.5 m and 1.5 m from tip
- **Extended:** Add 2.5–3.0 m for longer rods
- **Spacing:** Minimum 0.3 m between rings

### Mounting Method
- Wrap around insulating collar
- Secure with adhesive/epoxy
- Ensure flush contact with soil
- Maintain electrical isolation

### Electrical Connections
- Twisted pair wire inside rod wall
- Shielded cable recommended
- Connection to electronics pod
- Isolation from other rings and ground

### Waterproofing
- Epoxy seal at ring edges
- Heat-shrink over connections
- Ensure no moisture bridging between rings
- Test insulation resistance (>1 MΩ)

## Quality Control

- Verify ring-to-ring isolation
- Check ring-to-ground isolation
- Test contact resistance
- Verify waterproofing integrity
