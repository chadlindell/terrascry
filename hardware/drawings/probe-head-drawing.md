# Probe Head Drawing

## Overview

This document will contain detailed technical drawings of the probe head (nose capsule) assembly.

## Status

**Placeholder** - To be filled with:
- 3D CAD drawings
- Cross-sectional views
- Component placement
- Dimensional details
- Tolerance specifications

## Planned Content

### Capsule Design
- **Material:** PVC or 3D-printed (PETG/ABS)
- **Dimensions:** Ø25–32 mm, L80–120 mm
- **Features:** Removable cap, cable gland, mounting points

### Internal Layout
- Coil mounting positions (TX and RX)
- Electronics PCB placement
- Cable routing
- Potting volume

### Drawings Needed
- Overall assembly drawing
- Cross-section view
- Exploded view
- Individual component drawings
- PCB mounting details

## Manufacturing Considerations

- 3D printing: Layer orientation, support requirements
- Machining: Tolerances, surface finish
- Assembly: Clearance for components, serviceability
- Waterproofing: Seal design, gasket requirements
