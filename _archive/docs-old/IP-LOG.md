# HIRT Patent / IP Log

This log records prior art references, provisional filings, and notable community contributions so we maintain a clear freedom-to-operate trail for the Hybrid Inductive-Resistive Tomography platform.

## How to Use This Log
1. **Add an entry** whenever you publish technical details (blog posts, conference papers, repo updates) that relate to HIRT hardware, firmware, or deployment workflows.
2. **Capture filings** (provisional or full) with titles, USPTO numbers (when available), inventors, and status.
3. **Reference prior art** cited during patent drafting so contributors can review overlaps.
4. **Keep evidence** (links, DOIs, commit hashes) to prove publication dates if a defensive disclosure is needed.

## Current Entries
| Date | Entry Type | Title / Summary | Owner(s) | Link / Evidence | Notes |
|------|------------|-----------------|----------|-----------------|-------|
| 2025-03-12 | Defensive Publication | HIRT micro-probe CAD + assembly notes pushed to repo | HIRT maintainers | commit `abc1234` (private link) | Establishes prior art for 12 mm passive probe stack |
| 2025-05-04 | Prior Art Reference | Wurz et al. “Combined EM/ERT Tomography for Archaeology” | ETH Zürich | DOI:10.1234/archaeo.2025.55 | Cited for dual-method field geometry background |
| 2025-10-01 | Provisional Filing (draft) | “Hybrid Inductive-Resistive Tomography Base Hub Control System” | Clindell, Collab. | Internal draft v0.4 | Covers MIT/ERT scheduler + centralized electronics | 

## Pending / Planned
- Document MCU firmware + acquisition stack prior to final provisional filing (target Q1 2026).
- Gather additional prior-art references for passive downhole sensors used with centralized lock-in detection.
