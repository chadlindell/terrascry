This section provides detailed configuration recommendations for three primary application categories: bomb crater investigation, woodland burial search, and swamp/marsh crash sites. Each scenario requires specific probe lengths, spacing, frequency selection, and deployment strategies to maximize detection probability while maintaining operational safety.\n\nConfiguration selection depends on several key factors: target depth, soil conditions, site access constraints, and the nature of expected anomalies. The dual-channel MIT+ERT approach provides complementary information: MIT excels at detecting metallic objects (both ferrous and non-ferrous), while ERT maps soil disturbance patterns, moisture variations, and void structures.\n\n## Scenario 1: Bomb Crater Investigation {#sec-bomb-crater}\n\nBomb crater investigation represents the most demanding HIRT application, requiring deep penetration (3-4+ meters), comprehensive coverage of disturbed fill material, and detection of potentially large metallic masses. Typical crater dimensions range from 10-15 meters diameter with depths of 2-4 meters.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Bomb crater investigation configuration showing perimeter probe deployment around crater margin. Six 3.5m probes at 2m spacing provide comprehensive coverage through crater fill. MIT ray paths (green) interrogate the full volume including potential UXB location at crater base. ERT rings map fill boundaries and wet zones.](17-application-scenarios_files/figure-pdf/fig-bomb-crater-output-1.png){#fig-bomb-crater}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Configuration Parameters\n\n- **Rod Length:** 3.0 m (minimum; 3.5m preferred for full-depth coverage)\n- **ERT Ring Positions:** 0.5 m, 1.5 m, 2.5 m from probe tip\n- **Probe Spacing:** 1.5-2 m between probes\n- **Section Size:** Covers full crater plus rim (may require multiple sections)\n- **Probe Count:** 20-36 probes depending on crater dimensions\n\n### Measurement Strategy\n\n- **MIT Emphasis:** 2-20 kHz frequency range for aluminum/steel mass detection\n- **ERT Focus:** Map fill bowl geometry and identify wet pockets\n- **Depth Target:** 0-4+ meters (full crater depth plus underlying zone)\n- **Frequency Selection:** Lower frequencies (2-5 kHz) for maximum penetration\n- **Integration Time:** 10-30 seconds per measurement for improved SNR at depth\n\n### Deployment Considerations\n\nCrater investigation presents unique challenges including uneven surface topography, loose fill material, and potential UXO hazards. Initial deployment should focus on the crater rim where stable soil provides secure probe anchoring.\n\n- **Rim-First Approach:** Deploy perimeter probes before attempting center insertion\n- **Multiple Overlapping Sections:** Large craters may require 2-3 overlapping arrays\n- **Deep Insertion Protocol:** Use pilot rods to verify probe path before full insertion\n- **Extended Baselines:** ERT corner-to-corner measurements for deep investigation\n\n### Expected Results\n\nMIT measurements will show strong amplitude and phase anomalies from large metallic objects (engine blocks, landing gear, ordnance casings). ERT will map the crater boundary as a resistivity contrast between disturbed fill and native soil. Water accumulation at the crater base appears as low resistivity zones.\n\n## Scenario 2: Woodland Burials {#sec-woodland-burial}\n\nWoodland burial search requires high-resolution detection of relatively shallow targets (0.5-2 m depth) in environments complicated by root systems and organic material. The primary detection mechanism is ERT mapping of disturbed soil zones (grave shafts), supplemented by MIT detection of metallic artifacts.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Woodland burial site configuration showing dense probe array (7 probes, 1m spacing) for shallow target detection. Disturbed soil zone (grave shaft) shows distinct ERT contrast. Tree root systems require careful probe positioning. MIT detects small metallic artifacts (buckles, buttons) within burial context.](17-application-scenarios_files/figure-pdf/fig-woodland-burial-output-1.png){#fig-woodland-burial}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Configuration Parameters\n\n- **Rod Length:** 1.6 m (sufficient for typical burial depths)\n- **ERT Ring Positions:** 0.4 m and 1.2 m from probe tip\n- **Probe Spacing:** 1-1.5 m (tight spacing for small targets)\n- **Section Size:** 8x8 m standard search area\n- **Probe Count:** 12-16 probes for comprehensive coverage\n\n### Measurement Strategy\n\n- **ERT Emphasis:** Primary method for grave shaft detection\n- **MIT Frequencies:** 5-20 kHz range (focus on small metallic artifacts)\n- **Target Signatures:** Clusters of small anomalies suggest artifact concentrations\n- **Depth Target:** 0-2 m (standard burial depth range)\n- **Multiple Frequencies:** Sweep 5, 10, 20 kHz for sensitivity optimization\n\n### Deployment Considerations\n\nWoodland environments require sensitivity to site preservation. Use shallow insertion where possible and avoid major root systems. Document all surface features that may correlate with subsurface anomalies.\n\n- **Minimal Intrusion:** Shallow insertion protocol, narrow pilot holes\n- **Root Avoidance:** Survey root positions before probe placement\n- **Dense Measurement Pattern:** Short baselines for maximum near-surface resolution\n- **Complementary Methods:** Coordinate with GPR surface survey if available\n\n## Scenario 3: Swamp/Marsh Crash Sites {#sec-swamp-margin}\n\nWaterlogged and marshy terrain presents unique challenges for aircraft crash investigation. When bombers went down in soft, saturated ground, the combination of impact forces and unstable soil caused aircraft---and their crews---to sink progressively deeper over time. Unlike dry-ground crashes where wreckage remains near the surface, marsh impacts can result in debris fields extending 5-10+ meters below the current surface level.\n\nThe soft, organic-rich soil essentially \"swallows\" the wreckage: initial impact creates a crater that fills with water and sediment, while the weight of aircraft components causes continued subsidence over decades. This phenomenon is well-documented at WWII crash sites in Poland's Silesian marshlands, the Netherlands' polders, and similar low-lying areas across Europe.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Swamp/marsh crash site configuration showing probe deployment around the impact zone. Soft, saturated soil caused the aircraft to sink progressively deeper over decades. Extended 3.5m probes with low-frequency MIT (2-5 kHz) are essential for detecting debris at 5-8+ meter depths. Deployment platforms may be required due to soft ground conditions.](17-application-scenarios_files/figure-pdf/fig-swamp-margin-output-1.png){#fig-swamp-margin}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### The Deep Burial Problem\n\nWhen aircraft crashed into saturated marshland, several factors combined to drive wreckage deep underground:\n\n1. **Impact penetration:** High-speed impact into soft ground creates an initial crater\n2. **Waterlogging:** The crater immediately fills with groundwater\n3. **Progressive subsidence:** Heavy metal components continue sinking through soft peat and clay\n4. **Sediment accumulation:** Organic material and sediment fill the depression from above\n5. **Decades of compression:** 80+ years of soil compaction further buries the debris\n\nThe result: aircraft that hit dry ground remain within 1-2 meters of the surface, while marsh impacts can place wreckage 5-10+ meters deep.\n\n### Configuration Parameters\n\n- **Rod Length:** Maximum available (3.0-3.5 m) - depth is the primary challenge\n- **Probe Spacing:** 2-3 m around the perimeter of the suspected impact zone\n- **Section Size:** 8-12 m diameter coverage for typical bomber crash footprint\n- **Probe Count:** 8-12 probes in perimeter configuration\n- **Deployment:** Use platforms/boards on soft ground; may require temporary walkways\n\n### Measurement Strategy\n\n- **Low MIT Frequencies:** 2-5 kHz essential for maximum depth penetration\n- **Extended Integration:** 15-30 second measurements for weak deep signals\n- **Multi-Frequency Sweep:** Start at 2 kHz, sweep to 10 kHz to characterize depth\n- **ERT for Context:** Maps saturated zones and disturbed fill boundaries\n- **Repeat Measurements:** Multiple passes to confirm weak signals at detection limits\n\n### Deployment Considerations\n\nSoft ground conditions require careful planning for both safety and data quality:\n\n- **Ground Assessment:** Test soil firmness before committing to probe positions\n- **Deployment Platforms:** Plywood boards or temporary walkways distribute weight\n- **Probe Insertion:** May require pilot holes; avoid forcing probes through root mats\n- **Water Table Effects:** High conductivity of saturated soil limits ERT depth; rely primarily on MIT\n- **Seasonal Timing:** Drier seasons may improve access but water table remains high\n- **Extended Survey Time:** Budget 2-3x longer than dry-ground surveys\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Detection Limits\n\nTargets at 6+ meters in conductive saturated soil approach HIRT's detection limits. Expect:\n\n- Signal levels 10-20 dB below typical dry-ground responses\n- Higher uncertainty in depth estimates\n- Possible false negatives for smaller debris fragments\n- Need for multiple survey passes to confirm anomalies\n\nConsider complementary methods (seismic, coring) for confirmation of deep targets.\n:::\n\n## Scenario Comparison Matrix {#sec-scenario-comparison}\n\nThe following comparison summarizes key configuration parameters across all three primary scenarios. Selection depends on target depth, soil conditions, and site access constraints.\n\n| Scenario | Rod Length | Spacing | Frequencies | Depth Target | Key Method |\n|----------|------------|---------|-------------|--------------|------------|\n| Woods Burials | 1.6 m | 1-1.5 m | 5-20 kHz | 0-2 m | ERT + MIT |\n| Bomb Crater | 3.0 m | 1.5-2 m | 2-20 kHz | 0-4+ m | MIT + ERT |\n| Swamp/Marsh Crash | 3.0-3.5 m | 2-3 m | 2-5 kHz | 5-8+ m | Low-freq MIT |\n\n: Summary of configuration parameters by application scenario {#tbl-config-comparison}\n\n## Target Characterization {#sec-target-characterization}\n\nUnderstanding expected response patterns helps operators identify and classify anomalies during field operations. The dual-channel MIT+ERT approach provides complementary signatures for different target types.\n\n### Interpretation Guidelines\n\n- **Strong MIT + ERT Contrast:** Large metallic object in disturbed context (e.g., UXB in crater)\n- **MIT Only:** Metal object in undisturbed native soil\n- **ERT Only:** Soil disturbance without metallic content (possible burial, cache)\n- **Weak MIT Cluster:** Multiple small metallic artifacts (artifact scatter)\n- **Low ERT Zone:** Water accumulation, saturated fill\n- **High ERT Zone:** Air void, dry compacted material\n\n## Site Assessment and Configuration Selection {#sec-site-assessment}\n\nProper site assessment is essential for selecting optimal configuration parameters. The decision flow considers target depth, access conditions, soil type, and safety requirements.\n\n### Pre-Deployment Checklist\n\n1. Conduct site safety assessment (UXO clearance if applicable)\n2. Estimate target depth range from historical records or surface features\n3. Evaluate access conditions and identify probe deployment zones\n4. Assess soil type and expected conductivity\n5. Determine required spatial resolution for target detection\n6. Select configuration parameters from scenario guidelines\n7. Plan grid layout and probe numbering scheme\n8. Verify all equipment functionality before deployment\n\n## General Field Procedures {#sec-field-procedures}\n\n### Pre-Deployment\n\n- **Site Assessment:** Evaluate access, safety, and estimated target depth\n- **Configuration Selection:** Choose rod length, spacing, and frequencies per scenario\n- **Grid Planning:** Lay out probe positions with consistent numbering\n- **Equipment Check:** Verify all probes, base hub, tools, and cables\n\n### During Deployment\n\n- **Systematic Approach:** Follow 'set once, measure many' workflow\n- **Quality Control:** Check reciprocity, repeat critical measurements\n- **Documentation:** Record all conditions, anomalies, and deviations\n- **Adaptation:** Adjust strategy based on initial results if necessary\n\n### Post-Deployment\n\n- **Data Backup:** Secure all data immediately upon completion\n- **Quick Analysis:** Generate preliminary plots to verify data quality\n- **Equipment Care:** Clean, inspect, and repair probes as needed\n- **Documentation:** Complete field notes and measurement logs\n\n## Cost and Timeline Planning {#sec-cost-timeline}\n\nPlanning a HIRT deployment requires realistic assessment of equipment costs and build timeline. The following estimates assume standard components and moderate fabrication experience.\n\n| Component | Essential (12 probes) | Standard (20 probes) | Complete (24 probes) |\n|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Probes | $840-1,800 | $1,400-3,000 | $1,680-3,600 |\n| Base Hub | $200-500 | $200-500 | $200-500 |\n| Tools/Supplies | $200-400 | $200-400 | $200-400 |\n| **Total** | **$1,200-2,700** | **$1,800-3,900** | **$2,100-4,500** |\n\n: Estimated costs for HIRT system configurations. Actual costs vary by supplier, quantity discounts, and component choices. {#tbl-cost-estimate}\n\n### Build Timeline\n\n- **Week 1-2 (Prototype):** Build 2 prototype probes, document procedures\n- **Week 3 (Calibration):** Bench calibration, test target trials, design refinement\n- **Week 4-5 (Scale-up):** Build 12-20 probes, assemble base hub, field shakedown\n- **Week 6+ (Deployment):** First real section scans, procedure refinement\n\n## Recommendations {#sec-recommendations}\n\n### Start Simple\n\nBegin with the core MIT+ERT system on controlled test sites before attempting operational deployments. Build experience with probe handling, measurement protocols, and data interpretation before addressing complex field scenarios.\n\n### Add Selectively\n\nOptional enhancements (borehole radar, seismic crosshole, magnetometer sweep) should be added based on demonstrated need rather than theoretical benefit. Each addition increases system complexity and field deployment time.\n\n### Maintain Modularity\n\nThe modular probe design enables component replacement and configuration adaptation. Maintain this modularity by documenting all modifications and ensuring backward compatibility with existing components.\n\n## Case Studies and Field Validation {#sec-case-studies}\n\nEmpirical validation from prototype deployments provides essential ground truth for HIRT performance claims. This section documents field trials and their outcomes to guide expectations for operational surveys.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Case Study Status\n\nThe case studies below document planned or in-progress field validation efforts.
