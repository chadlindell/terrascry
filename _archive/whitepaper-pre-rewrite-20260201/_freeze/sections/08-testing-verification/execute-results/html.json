All probes must pass these tests to ensure reliable field operation. The testing framework covers mechanical integrity, electrical functionality, subsystem performance, and system integration.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Testing Philosophy\n\n- All tests must PASS for field deployment approval\n- CONDITIONAL status requires documented workarounds and supervisor approval\n- FAIL status requires repair, component replacement, and complete re-test\n- Quantitative measurements recorded for traceability and trend analysis\n:::\n\n## Testing Workflow {#sec-testing-workflow}\n\nThe HIRT testing workflow follows a systematic progression from basic mechanical verification through complete system integration testing. Each stage must be completed successfully before proceeding to the next, ensuring that fundamental issues are identified and resolved before more complex testing begins.\n\n### Test Sequence {#sec-test-sequence}\n\n1. **Mechanical Testing** - Verify physical integrity of rod, probe head, ERT rings, and cables\n2. **Electrical Testing** - Verify power supply, continuity, and communication interfaces\n3. **MIT Subsystem Testing** - Verify coils, DDS, TX driver, RX chain, and coupling response\n4. **ERT Subsystem Testing** - Verify ring isolation, contact resistance, and measurement chain\n5. **System Integration Testing** - Verify complete system operation and data collection\n6. **Environmental Testing** - Verify temperature stability and waterproofing (as applicable)\n7. **QC Sign-off** - Final documentation review and deployment approval\n\n\n\n## Pre-Testing Setup {#sec-pre-testing}\n\n### Test Equipment Required {#sec-test-equipment}\n\n| Equipment | Purpose | Minimum Specification |\n|-----------|---------|----------------------|\n| Power Supply | Probe power delivery | 5V or 12V, current-limited to 2A |\n| Digital Multimeter | Resistance, voltage, current | 0.1% accuracy, 4.5 digit |\n| LCR Meter | Coil inductance and Q factor | 10 kHz test frequency, 0.1% accuracy |\n| Oscilloscope | Signal verification | 50 MHz bandwidth, 2-channel minimum |\n| Function Generator | Signal injection testing | 1 Hz - 100 kHz, sine/square |\n| Base Hub | System-level testing | Complete calibrated unit |\n\n: Test equipment requirements for HIRT probe verification {#tbl-test-equipment}\n\n\n\n### Test Environment Requirements {#sec-test-environment}\n\n- Clean, well-lit workbench with adequate space for equipment and probe\n- Temperature: 20-25 degrees C (controlled room temperature)\n- Minimize EMI sources: move phones, radios, and switching power supplies away\n- Follow electrical safety procedures: use current-limited supplies, proper grounding\n- Prepare test log template, probe registry entry, and calibration sheet before starting\n\n## Mechanical Tests {#sec-mechanical-tests}\n\n### Test M1: Rod Integrity {#sec-test-m1}\n\n**Purpose:** Verify the probe rod is straight, undamaged, and properly assembled.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1.
