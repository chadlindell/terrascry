## Overview

This section documents validation protocols for verifying HIRT system performance against design specifications. Validation ensures that a newly constructed system meets the requirements for field deployment and provides traceable evidence for HardwareX journal compliance.

## Documentation Status

This section contains **Target specifications** that define expected performance. Measured validation data will be added as bench testing is completed. Specifications marked **(Target)** have not yet been validated against physical hardware.

## Validation vs. Testing

**Testing** (see [Testing & Verification](testing.qmd)) confirms that individual components and assemblies function correctly during the build process.

**Validation** confirms that the complete, integrated system achieves the performance specifications required for its intended use cases.

| Aspect | Testing | Validation |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Scope | Components, subsystems | Complete system |
| Question | Does it work? | Does it work well enough? |
| Criteria | Pass/fail functional checks | Quantitative performance metrics |
| Timing | During build | After build, before deployment |

## Validation Procedures

### MIT-3D Validation Protocol

**Equipment Required:**

- Calibrated oscilloscope (100 MHz bandwidth or greater)
- Signal generator with frequency counter
- Precision current shunt (0.1%, 10 ohm)
- Faraday cage or shielded enclosure
- Reference calibration targets (aluminum spheres: 5, 10, 25 mm diameter)

**Procedure:**

1. **Baseline Noise Measurement**
   - Place probe assembly in shielded enclosure
   - Record RX noise spectrum at each operating frequency
   - Verify noise floor < 100 nV/rt-Hz specification

2. **TX Current Verification**
   - Insert precision shunt in TX coil circuit
   - Measure RMS current at each frequency
   - Verify 10 ± 1 mA across operating range

3. **Phase Accuracy Test**
   - Apply known reference signal to RX path
   - Measure reported phase vs. true phase
   - Verify ± 0.5° accuracy

4. **Dynamic Range Test**
   - Position calibration spheres at known distances
   - Measure response from maximum (5 mm at 0.1 m) to minimum detectable
   - Calculate and verify > 80 dB dynamic range

5. **Cross-Probe Calibration**
   - Use identical calibration target at identical position
   - Measure response from each probe
   - Verify < 5% variation after calibration factor application

### ERT-Lite Validation Protocol

**Equipment Required:**

- Calibrated multimeter (6-digit resolution)
- Precision resistor set (0.1%: 10 ohm, 100 ohm, 1 kohm, 10 kohm)
- Variable resistance decade box
- Soil simulation circuit (parallel RC network)

**Procedure:**

1. **Current Source Accuracy**
   - Connect precision 100 ohm resistor
   - Measure actual injected current at each setpoint
   - Verify ± 2% accuracy

2. **Voltage Measurement Linearity**
   - Apply known voltages across measurement range
   - Compare reported values to reference meter
   - Verify linearity < 0.5% of full scale

3. **Contact Resistance Tolerance**
   - Insert series resistance (0, 1 kohm, 5 kohm, 10 kohm) in current path
   - Verify current regulation maintains accuracy
   - Document measurement error vs. contact resistance

4. **Reciprocity Bench Test**
   - Use resistor network simulating soil
   - Measure forward and reverse transfer impedance
   - Verify < 1% bench reciprocity error

### Integrated System Validation

**Test Tank Protocol:**

For systems with access to a controlled test tank:

1. Fill tank with uniform conductivity solution (e.g., 500 µS/cm)
2. Deploy 4-probe minimum configuration
3. Insert calibration target (metal sphere, PVC cylinder) at known position
4. Acquire MIT and ERT data
5. Process through standard inversion workflow
6. Verify target localization accuracy (position, depth)

**Target Specifications:**

| Parameter | Target | Method |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Lateral localization | ± 0.5 × probe spacing | Known target test |
| Depth localization | ± 0.25 m | Known target test |
| Size estimation | Within 2× actual | Known target test |

### Field Validation

**Protocol for First Deployment:**

1. Select site with known buried target (test installation)
2. Deploy full probe array
3. Acquire complete MIT + ERT dataset
4. Process and compare to known target position
5. Document any discrepancies

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- All probes communicate successfully
- Reciprocity error < 5% in field conditions
- Known target detected and localized within specifications
- No hardware failures during 4-hour continuous operation

## Validation Records

For HardwareX compliance, maintain documentation including:

1. **Calibration Certificates** for all test equipment
2. **Raw Validation Data** (oscilloscope captures, meter readings)
3. **Calculated Performance Metrics** with uncertainty estimates
4. **Pass/Fail Determination** for each specification
5. **Corrective Actions** if specifications not met

## Revalidation Requirements

Revalidate the system after:

- Major firmware updates
- Component replacement affecting measurement path
- Physical damage to probes or electronics
- Extended storage (> 12 months)
- Any unexplained measurement anomalies

Annual revalidation is recommended for systems in regular use.
