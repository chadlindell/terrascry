The modular design allows probes to be built by stacking fiberglass rod segments and 3D-printed sensor modules. The assembly process is designed for field conditions with minimal tooling requirements.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Hardware Documentation Reference\n\nDetailed assembly drawings and wiring diagrams are maintained in the hardware documentation:\n\n- **Assembly Drawings:** `/hardware/drawings/assembly-drawings.md` - Visual assembly guides\n- **Probe Head Drawing:** `/hardware/drawings/probe-head-drawing.md` - Detailed probe head construction\n- **Probe Assembly:** `/hardware/schematics/mechanical/probe-assembly.md` - Step-by-step mechanical assembly\n- **Manufacturing Notes:** `/hardware/cad/docs/manufacturing-notes.md` - 3D printing tips and troubleshooting\n\nThese hardware docs contain the most current assembly procedures and are updated as the design evolves.\n:::\n\n## Probe Assembly Overview {#sec-probe-assembly-overview}\n\nThe HIRT probe is a modular stack of 3D-printed components connected by M12x1.75 **(Manufacturer spec)** threads. The assembly comprises four main component types: probe tip, male rod caps, sensor bodies, and junction cap. Fiberglass rod segments (50 cm or 100 cm **(Target)**) bridge between sensor bodies to achieve the desired probe depth.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Exploded view of probe assembly showing component stacking order.

Color coding: green = sensor bodies, blue = male rod caps, dark gray = probe tip and junction cap.\n:::\n\nThe sensor body is the key component, housing both the MIT coil winding zone and ERT electrode groove. Each sensor body has female M12 sockets on both ends, allowing it to receive male rod caps from adjacent fiberglass segments.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Cross-section of sensor body showing internal features: dual female thread sockets (25 mm depth each **(Target)**), ERT ring groove at 1/4 position, MIT coil winding zone at 3/4 position, and 6 mm center wire channel **(Target)**.](assembly_files/figure-pdf/fig-sensor-detail-output-1.png){#fig-sensor-detail}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Thread Engagement {#sec-thread-engagement}\n\nProper thread engagement is critical for both mechanical strength and waterproofing. The M12x1.75 **(Manufacturer spec)** ISO metric threads provide approximately 6 full threads of engagement at the minimum 10 mm depth **(Target)**.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Thread engagement detail showing male rod cap threading into sensor body socket.

Rather than routing all probe cables directly to the main hub (which would require 600+ conductors **(Modeled)**), the system uses a **Zone Wiring Strategy** that aggregates signals through intermediate junction boxes.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Zone wiring architecture showing probe groupings, zone boxes, and trunk cable routing to the central hub. Each zone aggregates 4 probes through a passive junction box.](assembly_files/figure-pdf/fig-zone-architecture-output-1.png){#fig-zone-architecture}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### System Topology\n\nThe zone architecture divides the probe array into manageable groups of 4 probes each. Each group connects to a Zone Box (small passive hub) via individual probe cables. The Zone Box then connects to the Main Hub via a single high-density Trunk Cable. This reduces the number of cables entering the main enclosure from 20+ to just 5-6 trunk cables.\n\n- **Zone Box:** Small IP65 enclosure (100x100 mm **(Target)**) with 4 cable glands for probes and 1 DB25 connector for trunk output\n- **Trunk Cable:** High-quality shielded 25-conductor cable, 10-20 meters **(Target)**, carrying signals for 4 probes\n- **Advantages:** Modular expansion, clean installation, field-ready deployment\n\n### Wiring Harness Layout\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Wiring harness architecture from probe sensors through junction box and zone box to the main hub.

The pinout is standardized across all probes to ensure interchangeability and simplify field maintenance.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=7}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![12-pin Phoenix connector pinout showing signal assignments and recommended wire colors.

Use steady, even strokes with the hacksaw and rotate the tube to keep the cut square. After cutting, deburr the ends by removing fiberglass fibers with a file and sanding smooth with 400-grit **(Manufacturer spec)** sandpaper.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Rod Assembly Convention\n\n- Rods have Male threads at bottom, Female at top\n- Apply epoxy to flange of insert before installation\n- Ensure shoulder sits flush against tube cut\n- Allow 24 hours cure time before stressing threads\n:::\n\n### Field Assembly Sequence\n\nAssembly proceeds from the bottom (tip) and works upward. Each joint uses thread sealant and an O-ring for waterproofing. The cable is threaded through each segment before connecting.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=8}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Six-step assembly sequence: (1) Prepare probe tip, (2) Thread cable through first segment, (3) Add sensor module, (4) Seat O-ring on thread shoulder, (5) Stack additional segments, (6) Install top cap with cable strain relief.](assembly_files/figure-pdf/fig-field-assembly-sequence-output-1.png){#fig-field-assembly-sequence}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Base Hub Assembly {#sec-base-hub-assembly}\n\nThe base hub houses all electronics in a weatherproof enclosure.

The probe spacing depends on the target depth and desired resolution. For most archaeological and forensic applications, 0.5-1.0 meter spacing **(Target)** provides adequate coverage.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=10}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Top view of typical deployment configuration showing 4 probes in a 1-meter grid with cables running to the central hub.
