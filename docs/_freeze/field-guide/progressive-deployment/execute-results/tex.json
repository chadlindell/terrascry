This approach reduces risk, conserves resources, and enables data-driven decision making about where additional depth is warranted.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## When to Use Progressive Deployment\n\nThis is an advanced technique for experienced operators. New users should first master **standard fixed-depth deployment** (see [Deployment](deployment.qmd)) before attempting progressive workflows.\n\n**Best suited for:**\n- Large area reconnaissance where full-depth coverage is impractical\n- Sites with suspected UXO where minimizing ground disturbance is critical\n- Challenging soil conditions where depth achievement is uncertain\n- Research applications requiring depth-resolved data\n:::\n\n## Philosophy and Rationale\n\n### Why Progressive Approach Works\n\nTraditional geophysical surveys commit to a single deployment depth across the entire grid. This creates inefficiency: some areas may be over-sampled (features are shallow), while others are under-sampled (features are deeper than probes reach).\n\nProgressive deployment addresses this by:\n\n1. **Collecting data before committing resources** - Shallow survey reveals where deeper investigation is needed\n2. **Reducing mechanical risk** - Fewer deep insertions means less chance of hitting obstructions\n3. **Enabling adaptive sampling** - Focus effort where anomalies indicate potential targets\n4. **Preserving site integrity** - Minimize ground disturbance in sensitive areas\n\n### Data-Driven Depth Decisions\n\nAfter each phase, operators analyze data to answer:\n\n- **Where are anomalies detected?** --> Extend depth in those areas\n- **Where is background homogeneous?** --> Shallow data may be sufficient\n- **What depth do anomalies appear?** --> Plan next extension accordingly\n- **Are there indications of deeper features?** --> Continue extension\n\nThis transforms deployment from a single large commitment into an iterative refinement process.\n\n::: {.cell fig-height='5' fig-width='12' execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Comparison of fixed-depth vs progressive deployment strategies. Progressive deployment concentrates effort where targets are located, while fixed-depth provides uniform coverage regardless of subsurface features.](progressive-deployment_files/figure-pdf/fig-depth-profile-comparison-output-1.png){#fig-depth-profile-comparison}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Four-Phase Workflow\n\n::: {.cell fig-height='6' fig-width='12' execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Four-phase progressive deployment workflow. Each phase builds on data from the previous phase, enabling informed decisions about where to invest additional depth.](progressive-deployment_files/figure-pdf/fig-progressive-workflow-output-1.png){#fig-progressive-workflow}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Phase A: Shallow Survey (0.5-1.0 m)\n\n**Objective:** Establish baseline coverage and identify areas of interest.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1. Deploy probes to shallow depth (0.5-1.0 m) across entire grid\n2. Acquire MIT and ERT data at all frequencies/patterns\n3. Document any insertion difficulties (mark for later attention)\n4. Generate preliminary tomograms\n5. Export coverage quality metrics\n\n**Duration:** 60-90 minutes for 4×4 grid (probe insertion faster at shallow depth)\n\n**Data Products:**\n\n- Shallow depth slice tomograms\n- Coverage quality map\n- Anomaly detection summary (depth-limited)\n\n**Decision Point:** After Phase A data review, categorize each grid cell:\n\n| Category | Shallow Result | Action |\n|----------|----------------|--------|\n| Clear | No anomalies | May be complete (depends on target depth expectations) |\n| Anomaly detected | MIT and/or ERT signal | Extend to Phase C |\n| Ambiguous | Weak or edge signals | Consider extension or adjacent coverage |\n| Insertion problem | Probe didn't reach depth | Attempt different position or water-jet assist |\n\n### Phase B: Data Assessment\n\n**Objective:** Review Phase A results to guide selective extension.\n\n**Analysis Steps:**\n\n1. **Generate depth slices** at 0.25 m intervals through shallow volume\n2. **Identify anomalies** using standard classification criteria\n3. **Assess background** uniformity and noise levels\n4. **Map priority zones** for deeper investigation\n5. **Plan extension sequence** (order of probe deepening)\n\n**Key Questions:**\n\n- Do detected anomalies suggest targets at shallow depth (complete) or indicators of deeper features (extend)?\n- Which anomalies have highest investigation priority?\n- Are there coverage gaps that need lateral infill before depth extension?\n- What is the expected depth range for targets based on site context?\n\n**Output:** Prioritized list of probes for depth extension, with target depths.\n\n### Phase C: Selective Extension (1.5-2.5 m)\n\n**Objective:** Extend probes to intermediate depth in priority zones only.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1. Leave non-priority probes at shallow depth (they continue to provide data)\n2. For each priority probe (in sequence):\n   a. Disconnect cable from zone hub\n   b. Add rod segment(s) to reach target depth\n   c. Advance probe using appropriate method\n   d. Reconnect cable, verify connection\n3. Acquire new measurement cycle (full array, all depths)\n4. Reassess anomalies with improved depth coverage\n\n**Critical Technique:** In-place extension (see @sec-in-place-extension below)\n\n**Duration:** 15-30 minutes per probe extended (depends on soil conditions)\n\n**Decision Point:** After Phase C data:\n\n| Result | Action |\n|--------|--------|\n| Target localized at intermediate depth | May be complete; plan excavation |\n| Anomaly continues deeper | Proceed to Phase D (full depth) |\n| Anomaly resolved as natural feature | No further extension needed |\n| New anomalies revealed | Assess for additional extension |\n\n### Phase D: Full Depth Survey (2.5-3.0 m)\n\n**Objective:** Achieve maximum depth at selected positions for complete characterization.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1. Extend remaining priority probes to full depth\n2. Consider extending adjacent probes for improved deep coverage\n3. Acquire final measurement cycle\n4. Generate complete depth-resolved tomograms\n\n**Final Data Products:**\n\n- Multi-depth tomogram stack\n- Target localization with depth estimate\n- Coverage quality assessment\n- Recommendations for excavation\n\n## In-Place Extension Procedure {#sec-in-place-extension}\n\nThe modular M12 connector system enables depth extension without removing the probe from the ground.\n\n::: {.cell fig-height='5' fig-width='12' execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![In-place depth extension sequence. The four-step process maintains probe position while adding segments, avoiding the need to extract and re-insert.](progressive-deployment_files/figure-pdf/fig-depth-extension-procedure-output-1.png){#fig-depth-extension-procedure}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Equipment Required\n\n- Additional rod segments\n- M12 extension cables\n- Soft mallet (for final seating only)\n- Insertion tool (push handle or hydraulic assist)\n\n### Step-by-Step Procedure\n\n**Step 1: Prepare Extension**\n\n- Disconnect probe cable from zone hub\n- Inspect connector for debris or damage\n- Have extension segment ready with fresh O-ring\n\n**Step 2: Connect New Segment**\n\n- Align connector (key-way orientation)\n- Hand-tighten M12 connection\n- Verify cable routing won't snag during push\n\n**Step 3: Advance Probe**\n\n- Apply steady downward pressure\n- Use push handle or hydraulic assist\n- **DO NOT hammer** (UXO safety, connector damage risk)\n- Advance until new segment shoulder is at grade\n\n**Step 4: Verify and Reconnect**\n\n- Check that connector remained secure during push\n- Reconnect cable to zone hub\n- Run quick check (probe responds to ping)\n- Note achieved depth in field log\n\n### Connector Contamination Prevention\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Critical: Protect Connectors\n\nThe M12 connectors are the most vulnerable component during in-place extension. Soil contamination can cause:\n\n- Electrical contact failure\n- Water ingress on later submersion\n- Mechanical binding during future disconnection\n\n**Prevention measures:**\n\n- Cap disconnected connectors immediately\n- Keep connection point above ground level during push\n- Clean connector faces before each reconnection\n- Carry spare O-rings and cleaning supplies\n:::\n\n### Cable Slack Management\n\nWhen extending probes in place, the cable must have sufficient slack to accommodate the additional depth without tension on the connector.\n\n**Planning for Slack:**\n\n| Final Depth | Minimum Cable Slack | Recommendation |\n|-------------|---------------------|----------------|\n| 1.5 m | 0.5 m | Standard cable adequate |\n| 2.5 m | 1.0 m | Coil excess near zone hub |\n| 3.0 m | 1.5 m | Use extended cables |\n\n: Cable slack requirements for progressive deployment **(Target)**. {#tbl-cable-slack}\n\n**Slack Management Technique:**\n\n1. Before Phase A, deploy with excess cable coiled at surface\n2. As probes extend, feed slack into the hole\n3. Never allow cable tension during push operation\n4. After extension, route cable neatly to zone hub\n\n## Push System Integration\n\nFor depths beyond what hand-pushing can achieve, integrate with mechanical push systems.\n\n### Viable Insertion Methods\n\nResearch into probe insertion methods identified five candidate approaches, with three rated as highly feasible for HIRT deployment. The following comparison summarizes viable methods ranked by cost-effectiveness:\n\n| Method | Equipment Cost | Production Rate | UXO Safety | Best For |\n|--------|---------------|-----------------|------------|----------|\n| Water-assisted static push | $1,500-2,500 **(Target)** | 20-40 holes/day **(Target)** | SAFE | Initial testing, light use |\n| Lightweight purpose-built rig (HMIS) | $6,200-11,300 **(Target)** | 25-40 holes/day **(Target)** | SAFE | Standard operations |\n| Remote-controlled mini excavator | $60,000-95,000 **(Target)** | 15-30 holes/day **(Target)** | SAFE | High-risk UXO sites |\n\n: Viable insertion methods for HIRT probe deployment. All methods use static push (no percussion or vibration) for UXO safety compliance. Production rates assume a 2-person crew in typical soil conditions. {#tbl-insertion-methods}\n\nWater-assisted jetting represents the lowest-cost entry point: a portable pump and stainless steel lance create pilot holes to full depth, followed by probe insertion into the pre-formed hole with minimal force. This hybrid jetting-plus-push technique is recommended as the Tier 1 deployment method for initial field trials **(Target)**.\n\nFor standard operations requiring higher throughput, the HMIS provides an optimal balance of capability and portability at roughly one-tenth the cost of commercial CPT equipment.\n\n### Strategy A: Two-Pass Method\n\n**Concept:** Leave sensor probe at shallow depth; use separate push tool for deeper pilot hole.\n\n1. Create pilot hole with hydraulic push system (no sensors)\n2. Extract push tool\n3. Insert sensor probe into prepared hole\n4. Probe slides easily into pre-formed hole\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n- Sensor probes never subjected to high push force\n- Can use expendable pilot rods for difficult soils\n- Pilot hole can be slightly oversized for easy insertion\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n- Requires two insertions per position\n- Hole may collapse in unstable soils\n- Alignment between pilot hole and probe\n\n### Strategy B: Direct Push\n\n**Concept:** Push sensor probe directly with hydraulic assistance.\n\n1. Sensor probe attached to push system head\n2. Apply steady hydraulic force\n3. Advance probe to target depth in single operation\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n- Single insertion operation\n- No alignment issues\n- Works in collapsing soils\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n- Subjects sensors to push force\n- Requires robust connector design\n- Push force transmitted through probe body\n\n### HMIS System Specifications\n\nFor sites requiring mechanical push assistance, the HIRT Modular Insertion System (HMIS) provides a purpose-built solution.\n\n| Specification | Value |\n|---------------|-------|\n| Push force | 8-10 kN maximum |\n| Weight | 75-100 kg total system |\n| Stroke | 1.5 m (single operation) |\n| Power | Battery (48V) or 12V vehicle |\n| Anchoring | 4× helical ground anchors |\n| Control | 50 m tethered remote |\n| Transport | 2-person carry, fits in SUV |\n\n: HMIS system specifications **(Target, design goals)**. {#tbl-hmis-specs}\n\n**Estimated Cost:** $6,200-11,300 complete system **(Target)**\n\n**Production Rate:** 25-40 holes/day **(Target)**\n\nSee [Probe Insertion Methods Summary](../../research/deployment/probe-insertion-methods-summary.md) for comprehensive feasibility assessments of all five candidate methods.\n\n## UXO Safety Protocols\n\nProgressive deployment at UXO-suspected sites requires additional safety measures.\n\n::: {.cell fig-height='6' fig-width='10' execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Two-pass UXO clearance protocol for progressive deployment. Magnetometer sweep precedes each depth extension to verify the look-ahead zone is clear of ferromagnetic anomalies.](progressive-deployment_files/figure-pdf/fig-uxo-clearance-protocol-output-1.png){#fig-uxo-clearance-protocol}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Magnetometer Clearance at Each Depth\n\nBefore extending to each new depth, verify the look-ahead zone is clear of ferromagnetic anomalies.\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1. Use MIT channel in passive mode (TX off) if available\n2. Or use separate fluxgate magnetometer probe\n3. Clear volume: 1.5-2.0 m below current probe tip\n4. Abort threshold: >100 nT anomaly within look-ahead zone\n\n### Abort Thresholds by Depth\n\n| Depth | Magnetic Threshold | ERT Threshold | Action |\n|-------|-------------------|---------------|--------|\n| 0-1.0 m | 100 nT | 5,500 µS/cm | Caution, may proceed |\n| 1.0-2.0 m | 50 nT | 4,000 µS/cm | Pause, assess |\n| >2.0 m | 25 nT | 3,000 µS/cm | Stop, consult EOD |\n\n### Two-Pass Clearance Sequence\n\nFor maximum safety at high-risk sites:\n\n1. **Pass 1 (Shallow):** Deploy entire grid to 0.5 m\n   - Clear look-ahead before each probe\n   - Generate shallow anomaly map\n\n2. **Assessment:** Review map with EOD specialist\n   - Identify clear zones for extension\n   - Mark exclusion zones around anomalies\n\n3. **Pass 2 (Deep):** Extend only in cleared zones\n   - Re-clear look-ahead before each extension\n   - Maintain standoff from exclusion zones\n\n## Progressive Depth Profile\n\nThe following diagram illustrates how progressive deployment builds depth coverage incrementally:\n\n::: {.cell fig-height='8' fig-width='12' execution_count=6}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Progressive deployment depth profile across four stages. Phase A provides uniform shallow coverage, Phase C extends selectively where anomalies are detected, Phase D achieves full depth at the target, and the comparison panel shows the equivalent fixed-depth approach requiring 37% more total insertion.](progressive-deployment_files/figure-pdf/fig-progressive-cross-section-output-1.png){#fig-progressive-cross-section}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## When Progressive Deployment Is NOT Appropriate\n\nProgressive deployment adds complexity. Consider fixed-depth deployment when:\n\n- **Survey area is small** (4×4 or smaller) - overhead doesn't justify savings\n- **Target depth is known** - no benefit from shallow reconnaissance\n- **Time is limited** - multiple passes take longer than single deep deployment\n- **Soil is easy** - if full depth is achievable quickly, just do it\n- **Reporting requires uniform coverage** - some protocols mandate consistent depth\n\n## Summary: Progressive Deployment Decision Tree\n\n::: {.cell fig-height='8' fig-width='10' execution_count=7}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Decision tree for choosing between standard fixed-depth and progressive deployment strategies.
