This signal must survive a journey through 3-5 meters of probe cable and additional trunk cabling before reaching the preamplifier. Along this path, several factors conspire against signal integrity.\n\n**The dynamic range challenge:** When the transmitter coil energizes, it creates a strong primary field that dominates the measurement environment. The receiver must detect tiny perturbations caused by eddy currents in buried conductors - a signal that may be 80-100 dB weaker than the primary field. This explains why proper coil orientation, careful gain staging, and adequate TX/RX separation are critical.\n\n**Cable effects:** Every meter of cable adds capacitance that acts as a low-pass filter, attenuating high-frequency components. Longer cables also increase susceptibility to electromagnetic interference (EMI) pickup from power lines, vehicles, and radio transmitters. The twisted-pair and shielding specifications exist precisely to combat these effects.\n\n**Ground loops:** Multiple ground connections create parasitic current paths that inject noise directly into the signal chain. The single-point grounding strategy at the Hub eliminates these loops, but field modifications or damaged cables can inadvertently create new ground paths.\n\n### RX Saturation on Nearby Probes {#sec-rx-saturation}\n\n**Symptoms:** Amplitude readings maxed out on nearby probes, phase readings erratic or stuck, effects only visible on probes close to TX.\n\n**Causes:** TX output too high for close-range measurements, direct magnetic coupling between TX and RX coils, insufficient separation or poor coil orientation.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. **Reduce TX level:** Lower DDS output or TX driver gain\n2. **Increase separation:** Use wider probe spacing for close pairs\n3. **Rotate coils:** Ensure TX and RX coils are orthogonal\n4. **Add attenuation:** Use lower gain on RX for nearby probes\n5. **Skip close pairs:** Do not measure TX to RX pairs less than 0.5 m apart\n\n### Noisy MIT Data {#sec-noisy-mit}\n\n**Symptoms:** High noise floor, erratic amplitude/phase readings, inconsistent measurements between sweeps.\n\n**Causes:** Poor cable shielding, ground loops (multiple ground paths), electromagnetic interference from nearby sources, insufficient integration time.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. **Check shielding:** Verify all cables are properly shielded\n2. **Single-point ground:** Ensure only one ground connection at Hub\n3. **Twist pairs:** Use twisted-pair cables for signal lines\n4. **Increase integration:** Longer measurement time reduces noise\n5. **Check for interference sources:** Move away from power lines, vehicles, radios\n6. **Verify connections:** Check all connectors are tight and clean\n\n### No Depth Sensitivity (MIT) {#sec-no-depth-mit}\n\n**Symptoms:** Measurements do not change with depth, all readings similar regardless of target depth, no response to known deep targets.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. **Lower frequencies:** Use 2-5 kHz for MIT (deeper penetration)\n2. **Add longer offsets:** Include TX to RX pairs with >3 m spacing\n3. **Deeper probes:** Insert probes deeper if possible\n4. **Check targets:** Verify expected target depths are realistic for configuration\n\n## ERT Troubleshooting {#sec-ert-troubleshooting}\n\n### Understanding ERT Contact and Current Flow\n\nElectrical resistivity measurements depend fundamentally on establishing reliable electrical contact between the metal electrode rings and the surrounding soil. Unlike MIT which uses inductive coupling through air, ERT requires actual galvanic contact - current must physically flow from the electrode into the soil matrix.\n\n**The contact resistance problem:** When current flows from a metal electrode into soil, it encounters a transition zone where the current density is extremely high. This zone, typically only millimeters thick, often dominates the total resistance in the measurement circuit. Dry soil, air gaps, or organic debris around the electrode can increase contact resistance by orders of magnitude, making measurements unreliable or impossible.\n\n**Polarization effects:** When DC current flows through an electrode-soil interface, electrochemical reactions occur. Ions accumulate at the electrode surface, creating a counter-voltage that opposes the applied current. This \"polarization potential\" builds up over time and can completely obscure the subsurface signal. The solution is to use alternating current (AC) or periodically reverse polarity, allowing the accumulated ions to disperse.\n\n**Soil moisture dependence:** Soil conducts electricity primarily through the water filling its pore spaces. The dissolved ions in this pore water carry the current. Completely dry soil is essentially an insulator. This is why pre-moistening electrode holes and using conductive gels dramatically improves contact - you're providing the conductive medium the current needs.\n\n**Current channeling:** In heterogeneous soils, current preferentially flows through the most conductive paths. A buried pipe, wet clay lens, or metal debris can \"short circuit\" your measurement, causing all current to flow through this preferential path rather than sampling the volume you intend to measure.\n\n### Unstable ERT Voltages {#sec-unstable-ert}\n\n**Symptoms:** Voltage readings drift or jump, inconsistent measurements, poor contact indicated in diagnostic output.\n\n**Causes:** Dry soil preventing good electrical contact, poor ring-to-soil contact, loose connections, polarization effects at electrodes.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. **Pre-moisten hole:** Add water to improve contact\n2. **Use saline gel:** Apply conductive gel around rings\n3. **Check ring contact:** Ensure rings are flush with soil\n4. **Reverse polarity:** Use AC or periodic polarity reversal to reduce polarization\n5. **Check connections:** Verify all wiring is secure\n6. **Increase current:** Slightly higher current may improve SNR\n\n### ERT Contact Problems {#sec-ert-contact}\n\n**Symptoms:** High contact resistance, erratic voltage readings, some electrodes not responding.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. Verify ring contact with soil\n2. Add water around probe (improve contact)\n3. Check ring-to-cable connection\n4. Clean rings if accessible\n5. Consider relocating probe if contact remains poor\n\n### No Depth Sensitivity (ERT) {#sec-no-depth-ert}\n\n**Symptoms:** All measurements show surface effects only, no response to known deep features, uniform readings across array.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. **Longer ERT baselines:** Corner-to-corner, edge-to-edge injections\n2. **Deeper probes:** Insert probes deeper if possible\n3. **Wider spacing:** Increase array dimensions\n\n\n\n## Power Issues {#sec-power-issues}\n\n### Understanding the Power Distribution Architecture\n\nThe HIRT system distributes power from a central battery through the Hub to all connected probes via the trunk cable. This architecture creates both advantages (centralized power management, no individual probe batteries) and vulnerabilities (single-point failures can affect the entire system).\n\n**Voltage requirements:** The system operates at 12V nominal, with probes designed to function across a 10.5-14.5V range. Below 10.5V, the analog front-end loses regulation and measurements become unreliable. The 12.0V threshold in the troubleshooting procedures provides margin before this occurs.\n\n**Fuse protection:** A fuse in the power path protects against short circuits that could damage the Hub or create fire hazards. Fuses can also blow from cumulative stress - multiple small overcurrent events that don't individually trip but gradually weaken the fuse element. A marginal fuse may work intermittently, creating confusing symptoms.\n\n**Cable resistance:** Long trunk cables accumulate resistance that causes voltage drop under load. A 20-meter trunk cable with marginal conductor size might deliver only 11V to distant probes when the full system is active, even though the Hub shows 12.5V. This explains why probes at the end of long runs may behave erratically while closer probes work fine.\n\n### Probe Not Responding {#sec-probe-not-responding}\n\n**Symptoms:** No LED indicator, no communication with base hub, probe not detected in diagnostic scan.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. Check cable connections (both ends)\n2. Test with multimeter (continuity)\n3. Try different port on base hub\n4. Swap to spare cable\n5. Restart probe (disconnect/reconnect power)\n6. Replace with spare probe if available\n\n### Base Hub Not Powering On {#sec-hub-not-powering}\n\n**Symptoms:** No power LED, no response to power switch, system completely dead.\n\n**Causes:** Depleted battery, blown fuse, power switch failure.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. Check battery voltage (should be >12.0 V)\n2. Check fuse (replace if blown)\n3. Verify power switch operation\n4. Check internal connections if accessible\n5. Use backup power supply if available\n\n## Communication Issues {#sec-communication-issues}\n\n### Lost Probe Communication {#sec-lost-communication}\n\n**Symptoms:** Probe was working, now unresponsive; intermittent connection; partial data received.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. Check cable connections (both ends)\n2. Inspect cable for damage (kinks, cuts)\n3. Clean connectors with contact cleaner\n4. Swap to known-good cable\n5. Check for interference sources nearby\n6. Restart probe and base hub\n\n### Sync Problems {#sec-sync-problems}\n\n**Symptoms:** Timing errors in data, inconsistent measurements between probes, data corruption.\n\n**Causes:** Timebase distribution failure, clock drift, cable issues on sync line.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. Verify sync signal at each probe\n2. Check sync cable for damage\n3. Restart measurement system\n4. Re-initialize sync before continuing\n\n## Environmental Factors {#sec-environmental-factors}\n\n### Understanding Environmental Influences\n\nField instruments operate in conditions far removed from the controlled laboratory environment where they were calibrated. Temperature swings, humidity, precipitation, and electromagnetic interference all affect measurement quality in ways that can be subtle or severe.\n\n**Thermal drift:** Electronic components change their characteristics with temperature. Resistors drift, capacitors change value, and semiconductor junctions shift their operating points. Most critically, the analog signal chain - from coil inductance through amplifier gain to ADC reference voltage - experiences coordinated drift that can masquerade as real subsurface changes. The 15-minute warmup period allows thermal equilibrium to establish within the enclosure, after which drift rates become predictable and slow.\n\n**Moisture ingress:** Water is the enemy of electronics. Even without visible flooding, humidity can condense inside enclosures as temperatures drop, depositing conductive films on circuit boards. The IP67 rating provides protection during normal operation, but repeated seal compression, UV degradation of gaskets, and mechanical damage from handling gradually compromise protection. Regular seal inspection and desiccant replacement prevent insidious moisture damage.\n\n**EMI environment:** The electromagnetic environment varies dramatically between sites. Urban areas near power distribution, active construction sites, and locations near broadcast transmitters present challenges that remote field sites do not. The symptoms often appear as elevated noise floors or periodic interference patterns synchronized with power line frequencies (50/60 Hz and harmonics).\n\n### Temperature Effects {#sec-temperature-effects}\n\n**Symptoms:** Readings drift over time, morning vs. afternoon differences, inconsistent calibration.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. Allow system to stabilize (10-15 min warmup)\n2. Note temperature variations in field log\n3. Apply temperature compensation if available\n4. Take baseline measurements at current temperature\n5. Shield equipment from direct sun if possible\n\n### Weather Impacts {#sec-weather-impacts}\n\n**Symptoms:** Data quality degradation, increased noise, contact problems.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. Protect connections from moisture\n2. Secure cables against wind movement\n3. Use weather covers for sensitive equipment\n4. Postpone measurements in severe conditions\n\n## Field Repairs {#sec-field-repairs}\n\n### Field Repair Kit {#sec-repair-kit}\n\nKeep these items handy for field repairs:\n\n- Spare cables (2-3)\n- Spare probes (2-4 recommended)\n- Electrical tape\n- Multimeter\n- Small screwdriver set\n- Contact cleaner spray\n- Zip ties\n- Heat-shrink tubing\n- Solder and iron (battery powered, optional)\n- Notebook and pencil (for notes)\n- Calibration sheet\n\n### Emergency Cable Repair {#sec-emergency-cable-repair}\n\nIf a cable is damaged in the field:\n\n1. **Locate the break** (continuity test)\n2. **Cut out damaged section** if possible\n3. **Strip and splice** wires\n4. **Insulate with tape** or heat-shrink\n5. **Test before use**\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nField-repaired cables should be replaced at first opportunity.\n:::\n\n### Connector Cleaning {#sec-connector-cleaning}\n\n1.
