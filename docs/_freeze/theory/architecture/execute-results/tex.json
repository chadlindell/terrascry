The primary goal is to minimize ground disturbance while maintaining sufficient measurement quality for target detection. The result is a probe design with 10-16 mm outer diameter (target: 12-16 mm), representing approximately 10x less ground disturbance than traditional 25+ mm geophysical probes.\n\nThe design philosophy embraces a key constraint: many thin, gentle holes are preferable to fewer large ones. This approach is particularly important for sensitive archaeological contexts where visible disturbance must be minimized and backfilling should leave no lasting trace of the survey.\n\n## Probe Overview (Passive Micro-Probes) {#sec-probe-overview}\n\nEach HIRT probe is fundamentally **passive** - containing no active electronics downhole. Only sensors and wiring reside within the probe body, with all signal conditioning and processing occurring at the central electronics hub. This architecture offers significant advantages in reliability, cost, and field serviceability.\n\n\n\n### MIT Coil Set {#sec-mit-coils}\n\n- **1x TX coil + 1x RX coil** wound on ferrite cores\n- **Ferrite cores:** 6-8 mm diameter x 40-80 mm long\n- **Mounting:** Glued along rod (not in bulky head) for streamlined profile\n- **Orientation:** Orthogonal or slightly separated to reduce direct coupling\n- **Wire:** Fine wire (34-38 AWG), 200-400 turns for adequate signal strength\n\n### ERT-Lite Rings {#sec-ert-rings}\n\n- **2-3 narrow ring electrodes** (3-5 mm wide bands)\n- **Standard positions:** 0.5 m and 1.5 m from tip\n- **Deep extension:** Add third ring at 2.5-3.0 m for longer rods\n- **Material:** Stainless steel or copper foil\n- **Mounting:** Bonded with epoxy, flush with rod surface\n\n### Rod Construction {#sec-rod-construction}\n\n- **Material:** Fiberglass (G10) or carbon-fiber segments\n- **OD:** 10-16 mm (target: 16 mm with flush joints)\n- **Segments:** 50 cm or 100 cm lengths with M12x1.75 threaded couplers\n- **Total depth:** Up to 3 m with coupled segments\n- **Weight:** ~50-100 g per meter (much lighter than 25mm design)\n\n\n\n## Central Electronics Hub {#sec-electronics-hub}\n\nAll active electronics reside in a central hub unit, typically housed in a rugged IP65-rated enclosure. This centralized architecture simplifies probe design, reduces per-probe cost, and enables sophisticated signal processing that would be impractical in distributed electronics.\n\n\n\n### MIT Driver/Receiver {#sec-mit-electronics}\n\n- **Central DDS sine source** (e.g., AD9833) for 2-50 kHz operation\n- **TX driver amplifier** - drives all probe TX coils via trunk cables (10-50 mA)\n- **RX low-noise amplifier chain** - instrumentation amplifier with G=1000\n- **ADC/lock-in detection** - digital synchronous demodulation\n- **MCU** (ESP32 or STM32) for control, DSP, and data acquisition\n\n### ERT System {#sec-ert-electronics}\n\n- **Howland current source** - 0.5-2 mA, programmable via DAC\n- **Polarity reversal** - H-bridge for DC measurements with polarity cycling\n- **Voltage measurement** - differential amplifier (INA128) + 24-bit ADC\n- **Multiplexer** - High-density matrix (CD74HC4067) to switch electrode pairs\n\n### Power and Communications {#sec-power-comms}\n\n- **Power:** 12V or 5V battery pack, 10-20 Ah for full-day field operations\n- **Distribution:** Power remains at hub; only signals traverse trunk cables\n- **Data logging:** USB or WiFi connection to field tablet\n- **Control:** Centralized MCU handles all scheduling and sequencing\n\n## System Block Diagram {#sec-block-diagram}\n\nThe complete HIRT system follows a hierarchical architecture: Central Electronics Hub connects to multiple Zone Hubs via high-density trunk cables, with each Zone Hub serving as a passive breakout for 4 individual probes. This scalable design supports arrays from 4 probes (single zone) to 50+ probes (12+ zones).\n\n\n\n## Scalability Architecture: The Zone Strategy {#sec-zone-strategy}\n\nTo scale the system from a small prototype (4-8 probes) to a field-ready array (20-50+ probes) without creating an unmanageable cable harness, HIRT employs a **Zone Wiring Strategy**. This approach divides the array into logical zones, each containing 4 probes connected through a local Zone Hub.\n\n### The Challenge {#sec-zone-challenge}\n\nA single passive probe requires 8-12 analog conductors (TX coil pair, RX coil pair, 3x ERT rings, Shield, ID). Connecting 25 probes directly to a central hub would require terminating ~250-300 conductors at a single panel, creating severe mechanical congestion and crosstalk risks.\n\n### The Solution: Passive Zone Hubs {#sec-zone-solution}\n\n1. **Probes connect to a local Zone Hub:** A small, passive IP65 box placed on the ground near the probe cluster.\n2. **Zone Hubs connect to the Main Unit:** Via a single high-quality, shielded trunk cable (DB25 or 37-pin connector).\n3. **Central Hub manages Zones:** The hub switches between trunk lines to address specific probes via the multiplexer array.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Zone Wiring Benefits & Noise Immunity\n\n- **Modular Deployment:** Setup involves running a few thick cables rather than dozens of thin ones\n- **Signal Integrity:** Trunk cables utilize individual shielded twisted pairs for all analog lines\n- **Noise Rejection:** Differential signaling (balanced TX drive, instrumentation amp RX) rejects common-mode noise\n- **Field Repair:** A damaged probe cable only affects one local zone, not the main harness\n- **Scalability:** Add zones as needed without redesigning the core system\n:::\n\n## Signal Flow Paths {#sec-signal-flow}\n\n### MIT Signal Path {#sec-mit-signal-path}\n\nThe MIT measurement chain begins with the MCU generating a sine wave via Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS), which is converted to analog, filtered, and amplified to drive the TX coil. The induced signal in the RX coil passes through a high-gain amplifier chain before synchronous demodulation extracts amplitude and phase information.\n\n\n\n### ERT Signal Path {#sec-ert-signal-path}\n\nThe ERT system injects a known current (0.5-2 mA) between selected electrode pairs and measures the resulting voltage distribution. A Howland current source provides stable current injection regardless of load impedance, while a precision differential amplifier rejects common-mode noise from the measurement electrodes.\n\n\n\n## Multiplexer Switching Topology {#sec-mux-topology}\n\nThe analog multiplexer array is central to HIRT's ability to address any probe in the array. Using CD74HC4067 16:1 analog multiplexers, the system can route TX drive signals to any probe's TX coil and simultaneously route any RX coil to the receiver chain. Similar switching enables flexible ERT electrode pair selection.\n\n\n\n## Array Configuration Options {#sec-array-configurations}\n\nThe HIRT system supports multiple array geometries optimized for different investigation scenarios. Array configuration affects both lateral resolution and the distribution of ray paths through the target volume. The following standard configurations address common field requirements.\n\n\n\n| Configuration | Best For | Probe Count | Spacing |\n|---------------|----------|-------------|---------|\n| Square Grid | Unknown target locations | 16-36 (4x4 to 6x6) | 1.5-2.0 m |\n| Perimeter | UXO/hazard standoff | 12-16 | 1.5-2.0 m |\n| Dense Center | Known anomaly detail | 17-25 | 0.75-1.0 m center |\n\n: Array configuration selection guide {#tbl-array-configs}\n\n## Site Suitability and Method Selection {#sec-site-suitability}\n\nDeploying HIRT effectively requires understanding when the method excels and when alternative techniques may be more appropriate. While HIRT offers unique capabilities for simultaneous metal detection and soil disturbance imaging at depth, certain site conditions favor other geophysical approaches. We developed the following decision framework based on field trials across diverse investigation scenarios.\n\n### Comparative Method Assessment {#sec-method-comparison}\n\nHIRT occupies a distinct niche in the geophysical toolkit: it provides true 3D tomographic imaging through crosshole geometry while maintaining sensitivity to both conductive targets (MIT-3D) and resistivity anomalies (ERT-Lite). This dual-mode capability becomes critical when target characteristics are uncertain or when soil disturbance patterns provide complementary evidence to metal signatures.\n\n\n\n| Method | Depth Range | Resolution | Metal Sens. | Soil Sens. | Deploy Time | Relative Cost |\n|--------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------|-------------|---------------|\n| **HIRT** | 1-3 m | High (0.3-0.5 m) | Excellent (Al+Fe) | Excellent | 2-4 hrs | High |\n| GPR | 0-2 m | Moderate (0.2-0.4 m) | Good (if dry) | Poor | 1-2 hrs | Medium |\n| Magnetometry | 0-3 m | Low (0.5-1.0 m) | Fe only | None | 0.5-1 hr | Low |\n| Surface ERT | 0-5 m | Poor (1-2 m) | None | Good | 1-2 hrs | Medium |\n| EMI/Metal Detector | 0-1.5 m | Poor (0.3-0.8 m) | Good | None | 0.5-1 hr | Low |\n\n: Geophysical method comparison for subsurface investigation {#tbl-method-comparison}\n\n### When to Deploy HIRT {#sec-when-hirt}\n\nHIRT achieves optimal performance under conditions that favor both probe insertion and electromagnetic propagation. We recommend HIRT deployment when investigation requirements align with the following ideal conditions:\n\n**Soil Conditions:** Soft to medium soils that permit probe insertion to target depth without excessive force. Sandy loams, silty clays, and woodland humus layers are ideal substrates. Probes penetrate these materials with minimal disturbance, establishing reliable electrode contact for ERT measurements while maintaining stable coil positioning for MIT-3D.\n\n**Target Depth and Size:** Targets located in the 1-3 m depth range represent HIRT's performance sweet spot. Shallower targets often resolve more efficiently with surface methods (GPR, magnetometry), while deeper targets exceed the effective imaging volume given practical probe spacing constraints. Target dimensions should exceed approximately 0.3-0.5 m in at least one dimension to generate detectable anomalies.\n\n**Investigation Requirements:** Cases requiring simultaneous characterization of metallic objects and associated soil disturbance strongly favor HIRT over single-mode techniques. Archaeological features involving both ferrous artifacts and disturbed fill, bomb craters containing fragmented ordnance within backfilled soil, and aircraft crash sites with aluminum debris in displaced sediment all benefit from dual-channel imaging.\n\n**Site Geometry:** The crosshole measurement approach requires establishing a two-dimensional array surrounding or bracketing the target volume. Linear sites (pipeline corridors, trench lines) permit probe placement, but the resulting ray path distribution yields lower resolution than full perimeter deployments. Ideal sites allow 3-5 m diameter circular or square arrays with 12-25 probe positions.\n\n**Operational Context:** HIRT deployment makes practical sense when investigation time exceeds 2-4 hours and when the value of high-resolution 3D data justifies the setup effort. Single-point target confirmation often resolves faster with handheld metal detectors or penetrometers, but systematic surveys of unknown target distributions benefit from HIRT's comprehensive imaging capability.\n\n### When to Avoid HIRT {#sec-when-not-hirt}\n\nCertain site conditions fundamentally limit HIRT performance or present contraindications that favor alternative methods. Recognizing these scenarios prevents wasted deployment effort and ensures appropriate technique selection.\n\n**Ground Conditions Preventing Insertion:** Rocky substrates, heavily consolidated clays, frozen ground, and concrete/asphalt surfaces physically prevent probe insertion to target depth. We have attempted pilot hole methods in glacial till and weathered bedrock with limited success - the insertion effort becomes prohibitive and often damages probe assemblies. Sites with subsurface cobble layers or buried construction debris similarly resist probe penetration.\n\n**Electromagnetic Interference:** Dense urban environments with overhead power lines, buried utilities, and metal infrastructure generate continuous electromagnetic noise across HIRT's 2-50 kHz operating range. MIT-3D measurements become unreliable when ambient noise exceeds signal levels by more than 20 dB. ERT measurements remain functional in these conditions, but the loss of MIT capability removes much of HIRT's advantage over conventional resistivity surveys.\n\n**Extreme Soil Conductivity:** Highly saline soils, brackish groundwater, and seawater-saturated sediments create conductive pathways that short-circuit ERT current injection at typical 0.5-2 mA levels. While MIT-3D may still function, the loss of resistivity imaging again reduces HIRT to single-mode operation. Marine and coastal sites often fall into this category.\n\n**Shallow Target Distribution:** Targets located in the top 0.5 m of soil resolve more efficiently with surface methods. GPR provides rapid areal coverage without ground penetration, while handheld metal detectors locate ferrous and non-ferrous objects interactively. The HIRT deployment overhead (probe insertion, cable connection, measurement sequence) cannot compete with surface techniques for near-surface work.\n\n**Deep Targets Beyond Resolution Limit:** Targets deeper than 5 m fall outside HIRT's practical imaging range given realistic probe spacing (1.5-2.0 m) and signal strength limitations. While MIT-3D can detect large ferrous masses to greater depths in favorable conditions, the ERT component loses resolution rapidly beyond 3-4 m. Deep target investigations require borehole logging tools or surface geophysics with longer electrode arrays.\n\n**Constrained Site Access:** Linear sites, narrow corridors, and inaccessible terrain that prevent establishing crosshole geometry eliminate HIRT's primary advantage. Single borehole or surface-to-borehole configurations may still provide useful data, but they sacrifice the tomographic imaging capability that justifies the method's complexity. In these cases, simpler borehole geophysical tools often prove more effective.\n\n**Explosive Ordnance Risk:** Sites with confirmed or suspected unexploded ordnance require specialized protocols that may preclude invasive probe deployment. While HIRT offers perimeter-only array configurations for standoff detection (@sec-array-configurations), the insertion process itself presents unacceptable risk in extreme UXO scenarios. Professional explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) teams may prohibit any ground penetration until surface clearance completes.\n\n### Pre-Deployment Site Assessment {#sec-pre-deployment-assessment}\n\nBefore committing to HIRT deployment, we recommend a systematic site assessment to verify suitability and identify potential challenges. This rapid evaluation typically requires 30-60 minutes and substantially improves deployment success rates.\n\n**Physical Reconnaissance:** Walk the site perimeter and identify proposed probe locations. Probe the soil at 3-5 representative positions using a 10mm steel rod driven by hand or with light hammer blows. The rod should penetrate to target depth (typically 2-3 m) without excessive resistance. Encountering refusal depth, buried obstructions, or requiring heavy sledgehammer impacts indicates unsuitable conditions.\n\n**Soil Characterization:** Extract soil samples at proposed insertion depths using the same pilot rod or a hand auger. Examine texture, moisture content, and cohesion. Ideal soils form a cohesive core on the auger and show moderate moisture. Dry sand or saturated clay present challenges for electrode contact. Gravel-rich soils or highly organic material (peat, woody debris) may prevent effective probe insertion.\n\n**Electromagnetic Noise Survey:** Deploy a portable metal detector or EMI sensor at the proposed measurement frequency (typically 5-20 kHz for MIT-3D). Record background readings with instrument stationary for 1-2 minutes. Noise spikes exceeding 50% of expected target signals indicate challenging conditions. Identify and map noise sources (power lines, buried cables, metal fencing) and adjust array layout to maximize distance from interference.\n\n**Access and Logistics:** Verify vehicle access to within 50 m of the array center for equipment transport. Identify flat working area for central electronics hub placement with protection from weather. Confirm availability of electrical power for battery charging (if multi-day deployment) and data logging equipment. Map any access restrictions (locked gates, seasonal flooding, vegetation) that could delay deployment.\n\n**Regulatory and Safety Review:** Confirm land access permissions and any required permits for invasive investigation. For UXO sites, verify professional EOD clearance status and establish exclusion zones. Review archaeological site protections and ensure insertion methods comply with heritage authority requirements. Document landowner constraints on probe density, insertion methods, and backfill requirements.\n\nThe following checklist format facilitates rapid site assessment documentation:\n\n```\nHIRT Site Assessment Checklist\n\nSite: ________________  Date: ________  Assessor: __________\n\n[ ] Soil penetration test (10mm rod to target depth)\n[ ] Soil samples extracted and characterized\n[ ] EMI noise survey completed (background < 50% signal)\n[ ] Array geometry feasible (perimeter or grid)\n[ ] Vehicle access verified (< 50m from site center)\n[ ] Power source identified (battery charging)\n[ ] Weather protection available for hub\n[ ] Land access permission obtained\n[ ] UXO clearance confirmed (if applicable)\n[ ] Heritage authority approval (if applicable)\n\nSoil Type: ________________  Moisture: __________\nTarget Depth: ______ m      Probe Count: ______\nAnticipated Deployment Time: ______ hours\n\nProceed with HIRT:  [ ] Yes   [ ] No   [ ] Conditional\n\nNotes:\n_______________________________________________________\n```\n\nThis systematic assessment approach reduces deployment failures and helps investigators make informed decisions about method selection. When site conditions present significant challenges, hybrid approaches combining HIRT with complementary techniques often provide the most robust characterization strategy.\n\n## Insertion Methods {#sec-insertion-methods}\n\nThe slim 16mm probe profile enables multiple insertion methods depending on soil conditions. All methods prioritize minimal disturbance and safe operation.\n\n1. **Hand Auger:** 18-20 mm hand auger creates clearance hole, probe inserted without force\n2. **Pilot Rod:** 8-10 mm steel rod driven to depth, wiggled to ~14 mm, removed before probe insertion\n3. **Direct Push:** In sandy loam, probe may push directly (requires hardened tip)\n4. **Water-Jet:** In sand, water lance fluidizes soil; probe inserted as water drains\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Insertion Safety - UXO Sites\n\n- Never hammer or drive probes directly - use pilot hole methods only\n- Professional EOD clearance required before any insertion operations\n- Maintain 100m exclusion zone during pilot rod operations\n- Use perimeter-only deployment when UXB suspected at center\n:::\n\n## Advantages of Micro-Probe Design {#sec-advantages}\n\n1. **Minimal Intrusion:** ~10x less ground disturbance than 25mm designs\n2. **Easy Insertion:** Lightweight probes (~100g/m) require minimal force\n3. **Better Contact:** Slurry/water in insertion hole improves ERT electrode contact\n4. **Flexible Deployment:** Can achieve denser spacing; easy removal and backfill\n5. **Simplified Electronics:** Centralized hub is easier to maintain; passive probes are more reliable\n6. **Archaeology-Friendly:** Acceptable for sensitive contexts with minimal visual impact\n\n## Software Pipeline Roadmap {#sec-software-roadmap}\n\nWhile this document focuses on hardware, the HIRT system is designed to output data compatible with established open-source inversion frameworks. The 'Stage 2' software pipeline is currently in development to leverage these powerful tools:\n\n- **EIDORS (Electrical Impedance Tomography and Diffuse Optical Tomography Reconstruction Software):** Primary target for MIT-3D image reconstruction using finite element models.\n- **pyGIMLi (Geophysical Inversion and Modeling Library):** Target framework for coupled ERT/MIT inversion and multi-physics mesh generation.\n- **ResIPy:** User-friendly interface for the ERT component processing and inversion.\n\n## References {#sec-architecture-references}\n\n1.
