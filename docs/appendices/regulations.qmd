## Overview

This appendix covers legal, regulatory, and ethical requirements for HIRT deployment. For operational safety procedures, see [Getting Started: Safety](../getting-started/safety.qmd).

## "Permit to Dig" Requirements

In jurisdictions such as the UK (under **CIRIA C681**) and EU conflict zones, a "Permit to Dig" is strictly conditional.

**Workflow for HIRT Deployment:**

1. **Detailed Risk Assessment (DRA):** Must be completed by a competent UXO specialist before any site work
2. **Non-Intrusive Survey:** Surface magnetometry to clear the general area
3. **Intrusive MagCone/Probe:** Use passive magnetometry to clear the specific probe insertion point to depth
4. **Certificate:** Obtain a *UXO Clearance Certificate* for the specific coordinate
5. **Permit Issuance:** The Permit to Dig is issued only after the Clearance Certificate is attached

## Forensic Data Integrity and Chain of Custody

HIRT surveys conducted in support of criminal investigations, human rights documentation, or conflict archaeology must adhere to forensic standards that ensure data integrity and admissibility in legal proceedings.

### Why Chain of Custody Matters

HIRT-derived evidence may support criminal prosecutions, civil litigation, or international tribunals investigating war crimes. Data integrity depends on documented procedures satisfying three core requirements:

**Authenticity**: Proof that data originated from the stated location and time, collected by identified personnel using verified equipment.

**Continuity**: An unbroken record of who handled the data, when transfers occurred, and what actions were performed.

**Integrity**: Verification that data remains unchanged from collection. Cryptographic hashes (MD5, SHA-256) provide mathematical proof.

### Data Collection Protocol

Every forensic HIRT survey must capture comprehensive metadata:

**Survey Identification**: Use format `[DATE]-[SITE]-[OPERATOR]`, e.g., `20260130-KAMPALA-SMITH`

**Temporal Documentation**: Embed UTC timestamps in all data files. Record local time zone offset.

**Operator Credentials**: Record full name, affiliation, and certifications of all personnel.

**Equipment Traceability**: Log serial numbers of all probes, data loggers, GPS units, and calibration standards.

**Instrument Settings**: Record all acquisition parameters including frequencies, current levels, and filter settings.

### Field Documentation

**Site Photography**: Capture wide-angle photographs before probe insertion. Document each probe location. Include scale reference and compass orientation.

**Geolocation Data**: Record GPS coordinates (WGS84) using survey-grade receiver with sub-meter accuracy. Document DOP values.

**Environmental Conditions**: Log weather, soil moisture, and vegetation type.

**Witness Signatures**: In some jurisdictions, forensic surveys require independent witness verification.

**Field Sketches**: Draw scaled diagrams showing probe locations relative to permanent landmarks.

### Data Handling Procedures

**Original File Preservation**: Copy raw data to write-protected media immediately. Never analyze original files.

**Cryptographic Hash Verification**: Compute MD5 and SHA-256 hashes immediately after collection. Verify before any analysis.

**Secure Storage**: Use access-controlled, encrypted storage with audit logging. Maintain three independent copies.

**Access Logging**: Record every access to data files including date, time, user, and actions performed.

### Transfer Protocols

**Physical Media Transfer**: Use chain of custody form. Package in tamper-evident bags with serialized seals.

**Digital Transfer**: Use encrypted protocols (SFTP, secure cloud). Log transfer events with hash verification.

**Third-Party Analysis**: Establish written agreements specifying handling requirements and destruction procedures.

**International Transfer**: Cross-border transfers may trigger export controls and data privacy regulations. Consult legal counsel.

### Reporting Requirements

**Methodology Section**: Describe HIRT measurement principle, configuration, and processing workflow in sufficient detail for independent evaluation.

**Software Documentation**: Identify all software with version numbers and configuration settings.

**Limitations and Uncertainty**: State measurement uncertainties, depth resolution limits, and factors affecting interpretation. Provide confidence levels.

**Operator Qualifications**: Include statement of education, training, and experience.

**Peer Review**: Consider independent review for high-stakes proceedings.

## Applicable Standards

HIRT forensic data handling should align with established standards:

- **ASTM E1492-23**: Standard Practice for Receiving, Documenting, Storing, and Retrieving Evidence in a Forensic Science Laboratory
- **ISO/IEC 27037:2012**: Guidelines for identification, collection, acquisition, and preservation of digital evidence
- **SWGDE Best Practices for Computer Forensics** (Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence)
- **NIJ Electronic Crime Scene Investigation Guide** (US National Institute of Justice)
- **IMAS 07.11**: International Mine Action Standards for Land Release
- **CIRIA C681**: Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) A Guide for the Construction Industry (UK)
