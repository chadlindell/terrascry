# Welcome to HIRT

**HIRT (Hybrid Inductive-Resistivity Tomography)** is a dual-channel subsurface imaging system designed for archaeological, forensic, and environmental investigations. By combining magneto-inductive (MIT-3D) and electrical resistivity (ERT-Lite) tomography in a crosshole configuration, HIRT achieves true 3D imaging of subsurface features at depths where surface methods fail.

This technical manual provides complete documentation for building, operating, and understanding the HIRT system.

## Who Is This Manual For?

This documentation follows an "onion model"—start from the layer that matches your needs:

### Field Operators

**Start here:** [Field Guide](field-guide/deployment.qmd)

You have a working HIRT system and need to conduct surveys. The Field Guide covers deployment, data acquisition, interpretation, and troubleshooting without requiring deep technical knowledge.

### Builders

**Start here:** [Build Guide](build-guide/bill-of-materials.qmd)

You want to construct a HIRT system. The Build Guide provides complete bills of materials, mechanical design, electronics, assembly procedures, and testing/validation protocols.

### Researchers and Students

**Start here:** [Theory](theory/physics.qmd)

You want to understand the physics, algorithms, and design decisions behind HIRT. The Theory section covers electromagnetic induction, resistivity tomography, inversion mathematics, and multi-modal fusion.

### Developers

**Start here:** [Developer Guide](developer/contributing.qmd)

You want to contribute code, improve firmware, or extend HIRT capabilities. The Developer Guide covers data formats, firmware architecture, and the project roadmap.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

Some topics span multiple layers. Use these links when your question crosses boundaries:

**Troubleshooting:** If a problem occurs in the field, start with [Field Troubleshooting](field-guide/troubleshooting.qmd). If you suspect a build issue, see [Testing & Verification](build-guide/testing.qmd). For theory behind the symptoms, check [Uncertainty & Limitations](theory/uncertainty.qmd).

**Calibration:** Field operators should follow [Field Calibration](build-guide/calibration.qmd) procedures. Builders should understand [Testing & Verification](build-guide/testing.qmd) before delivery. Theory users can find calibration mathematics in [Inversion](theory/inversion.qmd).

**Data Formats:** For recording data in the field, see [Data Acquisition](field-guide/data-acquisition.qmd). For file specifications and software compatibility, see [Data Formats](developer/data-formats.qmd).

## System Overview

HIRT uses two complementary sensing channels:

**MIT-3D (Magneto-Inductive Tomography):** Low-frequency TX/RX coils (2-50 kHz) detect metallic objects, including non-ferrous metals like aluminum that are invisible to magnetometers.

**ERT-Lite (Electrical Resistivity Tomography):** Ring electrodes inject small currents (0.5-2 mA) to map soil disturbance, moisture content, and resistivity contrasts.

The crosshole geometry—with probes inserted into the ground—provides direct ray paths through the target volume, achieving 2-5× better resolution than surface methods at depths beyond 2 meters (*modeled estimate; field validation pending*).

### Primary Applications

- **Filled bomb crater investigation:** UXO, remains, structural debris
- **Forest burial detection:** Clandestine graves, historical burials
- **Crash site recovery:** Aircraft wreckage in challenging terrain
- **Environmental assessment:** Contamination plumes, buried waste

## Documentation Standards

This manual uses consistent terminology and formatting:

- **Specifications** are qualified as *Measured*, *Modeled*, or *Target*
- **MIT-3D** refers to the inductive channel (not "EMI" or "metal detector")
- **ERT-Lite** refers to the resistivity channel (not "galvanic")
- **Crosshole** describes the measurement geometry
- Units follow SI conventions with space between value and unit (e.g., "16 mm")

See the [Glossary](appendices/glossary.qmd) for complete terminology.

## Project Status

HIRT is open-source scientific hardware under active development. Current status:

- **Hardware design:** Mature (revision 2.3)
- **Build documentation:** Complete
