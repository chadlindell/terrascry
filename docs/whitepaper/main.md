## Introduction

**Hybrid Inductive-Resistive Tomography (HIRT)** is a modular, in-ground probe array integrating magneto-inductive (low-frequency EM) and electrical resistivity measurements for high-resolution 3-D subsurface imaging in archaeological and forensic contexts.

> "We employed a Hybrid Inductive-Resistive Tomography (HIRT) probe array, a novel low-intrusion subsurface imaging method developed for archaeological recovery of WWII aircraft crash sites. The system integrates magneto-inductive and electrical resistivity measurements using modular dual-role probes to generate volumetric conductivity and resistivity models to depths of 3–6 m."

This document focuses on **hardware and field methods**; software processing is explicitly a later step.
