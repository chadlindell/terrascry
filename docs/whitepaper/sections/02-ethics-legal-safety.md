# 2. Ethics, Legal & Safety

## Human Remains

Treat as a **forensic/archaeological context**:
- Obtain all **permits/permissions** before deployment
- Follow jurisdictional requirements (e.g., heritage boards, war graves authorities)
- Maintain proper chain of custody for any findings
- Document all activities thoroughly

## UXO Risk

**CRITICAL:** WWII sites can contain live ordnance.

- **Do not drive or hammer probes** until the area is **cleared by qualified EOD/UXO professionals**
- Coordinate with explosive ordnance disposal teams
- Follow established UXO clearance protocols
- Maintain safe standoff distances during operations

## Minimal Intrusion

- Prefer **rim/perimeter probing** over direct insertion into suspected areas
- Use **shallow depths** when possible
- Employ **pilot holes** to minimize ground disturbance
- **Avoid inserting probes into suspected burial voids** without authorization
- Document all probe insertion points and depths

## Field Safety

- Maintain clear communication protocols
- Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
- Have emergency contact information readily available
- Follow local environmental regulations
- Respect site boundaries and access restrictions
