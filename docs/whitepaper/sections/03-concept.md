# 3. Concept: Why Probes (Not Only Surface Scans)

## Limitations of Surface Methods

Surface GPR/magnetometry are excellent screeners but can yield:
- **Ambiguous reflections** in complex subsurface conditions
- **Limited depth** in conductive soils
- **Reduced resolution** for small or deep targets
- **Difficulty distinguishing** multiple overlapping anomalies

## Advantages of In-Ground Probes

By placing **sensors inside the ground** and measuring **through** the volume (**crosshole** geometry), we obtain **true tomographic coverage**—clearer 3D models of:

- **Conductive metal masses** (including aluminum)
- **Disturbed/moist soils** (grave shafts, crater fill)
- **Voids/compaction changes**

## Dual-Channel Approach

This guide uses two complementary channels:

### 1. MIT‑3D (Magneto‑Inductive Tomography)
- Low‑frequency **TX/RX coils** on rods
- Measure **amplitude + phase** changes
- Caused by **eddy currents** in conductive bodies (aluminum/steel)
- Maps bulk conductivity structure

### 2. ERT‑Lite (Electrical Resistivity)
- **Small ring electrodes** on rods
- Inject tiny currents and read voltages
- Maps **soil resistivity** (moisture/disturbance/voids)

## Design Philosophy

> **Design rule:** Make each probe **dual‑role** (TX & RX for MIT) **plus** ERT pickup. Identical probes simplify logistics and improve data quality.

**Benefits:**
- Modular, interchangeable components
- Simplified field operations
- Consistent calibration across probes
- Reduced cost through standardization
