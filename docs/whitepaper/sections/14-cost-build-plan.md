- **Refine** procedures based on field experience
- **Build** remaining probes if needed
- **Document** lessons learned

**Deliverables:**
- Field-ready system
- Field deployment procedures
- Initial field data

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Reduce Per-Probe Cost
- **Bulk ordering:** Order components for all probes at once
- **Component selection:** Choose cost-effective alternatives where possible
- **DIY fabrication:** 3D print/machine components yourself
- **Simplified design:** Reduce complexity where acceptable

### Phased Approach
- **Phase 1:** Build 12 probes + base hub (~$1,000–2,000)
- **Phase 2:** Add 8–12 more probes as needed (~$600–1,800)
- **Phase 3:** Add spares and upgrades (~$200–600)

### Alternative Approaches
- **Shared components:** Some teams may share base hub
- **Modular expansion:** Start small, expand as needed
- **Used components:** Source some components used/refurbished

## Budget Considerations

### Essential (Minimum Viable System)
- 12 probes: $840–1,800
- Base hub: $200–500
- Tools: $200–400
- **Total:** ~$1,200–2,700

### Recommended (Standard Section)
- 20 probes: $1,400–3,000
- Base hub: $200–500
- Tools: $200–400
- **Total:** ~$1,800–3,900

### Complete (With Spares)
- 24 probes (20 + 4 spares): $1,680–3,600
- Base hub: $200–500
- Tools: $200–400
- **Total:** ~$2,100–4,500

## Ongoing Costs

### Consumables
- Batteries: $30–120 per field season
- Cables (replacement): $20–60 as needed
- Seals/gaskets: $10–30 per season

### Maintenance
- Calibration: Time, minimal cost
- Repairs: Varies, budget 10% of initial cost per year
- Upgrades: Optional, varies

## Return on Investment

### Compared to Commercial Systems
- Commercial systems: $50,000–200,000+
- DIY HIRT system: $1,800–3,900
- **Savings:** 95%+ compared to commercial

### Value Delivered
- High-resolution 3D subsurface imaging
- Modular, repairable system
- Customizable for specific needs
- Educational/research value
- Field-proven methodology

## Procurement Tips

### Ordering Strategy
1. **Research suppliers:** Compare prices, quality, availability
2. **Bulk orders:** Order all components at once for discounts
3. **Lead times:** Account for shipping and manufacturing delays
4. **Spares:** Order extra critical components
5. **Documentation:** Keep receipts and part numbers

### Key Suppliers
- **Electronics:** Digi-Key, Mouser, Adafruit, SparkFun
