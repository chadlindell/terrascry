- [ ] Probe registry updated
- [ ] Site maps/plans available
- [ ] Previous survey data (if applicable)

## On Site Checklist

### Site Setup
- [ ] Establish control area (background scan location)
- [ ] Lay out section grid
- [ ] Record coordinates (GPS/total station)
- [ ] Document site conditions (soil, moisture, weather)
- [ ] Mark probe positions with flags

### Probe Deployment
- [ ] Insert probes systematically
- [ ] Verify depths & IDs match records
- [ ] Check probe orientation (if applicable)
- [ ] Verify all probes have power
- [ ] Test communications with all probes

### Data Collection
- [ ] Run background scan (control area)
- [ ] Run MIT sweep (all TX; multi‑freq)
  - [ ] Verify all frequencies measured
  - [ ] Check for saturation or errors
- [ ] Run ERT patterns (2–4 baselines; flip polarity)
  - [ ] Verify current injection working
  - [ ] Check voltage readings reasonable
- [ ] QC repeats (5–10% of pairs)
  - [ ] Verify reciprocity (A→B ≈ B→A)
  - [ ] Check consistency

### Quality Control
- [ ] Monitor data quality in real-time
- [ ] Note any anomalies or issues
- [ ] Document any disturbances
- [ ] Verify time synchronization
- [ ] Check for ground loops or noise

### Section Completion
- [ ] All measurements completed
- [ ] Data backed up (if possible on-site)
- [ ] Extract probes carefully
- [ ] Move to next section (keep overlap if possible)
- [ ] Update field log

## Post‑Deployment Checklist

### Data Management
- [ ] Back up CSVs to secure storage
- [ ] Photo log of the grid (if taken)
- [ ] Quick sanity plots (amp/phase vs distance)
- [ ] Verify data completeness
- [ ] Organize files by section/date

### Equipment Care
- [ ] Decontaminate/inspect probes
- [ ] Note any repairs needed
- [ ] Clean connectors and cables
- [ ] Check for damage
- [ ] Store equipment properly

### Documentation
- [ ] Complete field notes
- [ ] Update probe registry with any changes
- [ ] Document any issues encountered
- [ ] Note lessons learned
- [ ] Prepare preliminary report (if needed)

### Follow-Up
- [ ] Review data quality
- [ ] Identify any missing measurements
- [ ] Plan next steps (additional sections, processing)
- [ ] Schedule equipment maintenance
- [ ] Update procedures based on experience

## Emergency Procedures

### Safety Incidents
- [ ] Stop work immediately if unsafe conditions
- [ ] Evacuate if necessary
- [ ] Contact emergency services
- [ ] Document incident
- [ ] Report to site supervisor

### Equipment Failure
- [ ] Isolate failed component
- [ ] Use spare if available
- [ ] Document failure for repair
- [ ] Continue with remaining probes if possible
- [ ] Adjust survey plan if needed

### Data Loss
- [ ] Attempt recovery if possible
- [ ] Document what was lost
- [ ] Re-measure if critical
- [ ] Improve backup procedures
- [ ] Learn from incident
