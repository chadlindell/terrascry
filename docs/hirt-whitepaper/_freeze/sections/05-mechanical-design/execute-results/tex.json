The design philosophy prioritizes minimal ground disturbance while maintaining robust measurement capability.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Hardware Documentation Reference\n\nCAD files, manufacturing guides, and detailed drawings are maintained in the hardware documentation:\n\n- **CAD Files:** `/hardware/cad/` - OpenSCAD source files and STL exports\n- **Manufacturing Guide:** `/hardware/cad/docs/manufacturing-guide.md` - Printing settings and post-processing\n- **Probe Assembly:** `/hardware/schematics/mechanical/probe-assembly.md` - Detailed assembly drawings\n- **Rod Specifications:** `/hardware/schematics/mechanical/rod-specifications.md` - Material and dimensional specifications\n- **ERT Ring Mounting:** `/hardware/schematics/mechanical/er-ring-mounting.md` - Electrode installation details\n\nSee `/hardware/cad/QUICKSTART.md` for getting started with the CAD files.\n:::\n\n## Design Philosophy {#sec-mech-design-philosophy}\n\n**\"Archaeologist brain first, engineer brain second\"** - This guiding principle shapes every aspect of the HIRT mechanical design. The goal is to create the smallest possible hole while retaining enough physics (coil area, electrode contact) for quality signals. The constraint leads to many thin, gentle holes rather than few large ones, resulting in approximately 10x less disturbance than conventional designs.\n\n## Core Design Principles {#sec-core-principles}\n\n- **No big electronics at the tip:** PCBs, ADCs, MCUs stay at surface. Only passive components downhole.\n- **Probes are mostly passive:** Downhole contains only coils and electrodes plus thin wiring. All \"smart\" electronics reside in junction box above ground.\n- **Rod diameter standard: 16mm OD:** Robust hiking pole standard allowing strong M12 threads. Hole size of 18-20mm is much less destructive than traditional 50mm.\n\n\n\n## Disturbance Comparison {#sec-disturbance-comparison}\n\nThe micro-probe design achieves dramatic reduction in soil disturbance compared to traditional geophysical probes. A 16mm rod requires only an 18-20mm hole, with cross-sectional area of approximately 2.5-3.0 cm^2^. At 3m depth, this creates only 0.75-1.0 liters of displacement per hole. In contrast, traditional 25mm rods requiring 50mm holes displace approximately 6 liters per hole - a 7-10x increase in disturbance.\n\n\n\n## Key Dimensions {#sec-key-dimensions}\n\n| Component | Dimension | Notes |\n|-----------|-----------|-------|\n| Rod OD | 16 mm | Increased from 12mm for strength |\n| Rod ID | 12-13 mm | Standard pultruded tube |\n| Wall Thickness | 1.5-2.0 mm | Structural requirement |\n| Segment Length | 50, 100 cm | Defines sensor spacing |\n| Hole Size | 18-20 mm | For 16mm rod insertion |\n| Total Length | 2.5-3.0 m | Multiple segments assembled |\n\n: Key dimensional specifications for the HIRT micro-probe system. {#tbl-dimensions}\n\n## Rod Segments and Couplers {#sec-rod-segments}\n\n## Rod Material Selection {#sec-material-selection}\n\nMaterial selection is critical for probe performance. The rod must be non-conductive to avoid interference with electromagnetic measurements, strong enough to withstand insertion forces, and durable for repeated field use. Fiberglass (G10) emerges as the preferred material due to its combination of high strength, non-conductivity, RF transparency, and moderate cost.\n\n\n\n| Parameter | Specification |\n|-----------|---------------|\n| Outer Diameter (OD) | 16 mm (approx. 5/8\") |\n| Inner Diameter (ID) | 12-13 mm |\n| Wall Thickness | ~1.5-2.0 mm |\n| Material | Fiberglass (non-conductive, RF transparent) |\n| Segment Lengths | 50 cm, 100 cm (spacers) |\n\n: Fiberglass rod specifications. {#tbl-fiberglass}\n\n## Modular Connector System {#sec-modular-connector}\n\nThe system uses a 2-part connector system permanently epoxied into rod ends to create a screw-together stack. The male insert provides the threaded portion while the female insert/sensor module receives the thread and houses sensors. This flush-mount design ensures a smooth 16mm OD profile throughout, preventing snag points during insertion and extraction.\n\n\n\n## Thread Specifications {#sec-thread-specs}\n\nAll threaded connections use M12x1.75 ISO standard metric threads. This provides adequate strength for field assembly while remaining manufacturable via 3D printing with post-processing. The \"chunky\" thread profile improves printability while maintaining engagement strength.\n\n\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n|-----------|-------|\n| Thread Type | M12x1.75 ISO Standard |\n| Pitch | 1.75 mm |\n| Major Diameter | 12.0 mm |\n| Engagement Length | 12-15 mm |\n| Print Oversize (Male) | 12.2 mm (for Die cutting) |\n| Print Undersize (Female) | 10.5 mm hole (for Tapping) |\n\n: Thread specifications for modular connections. {#tbl-thread}\n\n## Coil Mounting and Ferrite Cores {#sec-coil-mounting}\n\nThe MIT sensing coils are wound onto ferrite rod cores positioned along the probe body. This configuration keeps coils internal to the 16mm profile, adding only 1-2mm to the rod OD with potting. Coils are positioned orthogonally (90 degree separation) to minimize direct coupling between TX and RX elements.\n\n\n\n| Parameter | Specification |\n|-----------|---------------|\n| Diameter | 6-8 mm |\n| Length | 40-80 mm |\n| Material | MnZn ferrite |\n| Quantity | 1-2 per probe (TX/RX) |\n\n: Ferrite core specifications. {#tbl-ferrite}\n\n| Parameter | Specification |\n|-----------|---------------|\n| Wire Gauge | 34-38 AWG (fine wire) |\n| Turns | 200-400 turns |\n| Target Inductance | 1-2 mH |\n| Target Q Factor | >20 |\n\n: Coil winding specifications. {#tbl-coil-winding}\n\n## ERT Ring Electrodes {#sec-mech-ert-rings}\n\nElectrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) electrodes are implemented as narrow stainless steel or copper ring bands mounted on 3D-printed insulating collars. The rings are flush-mounted to maintain the smooth probe profile. Multiple rings (typically 2-3 per probe) enable various measurement configurations.\n\n\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n|-----------|-------|\n| Ring Material | Stainless steel (316L) or copper |\n| Ring Width | 3-5 mm (narrow bands) |\n| Ring Thickness | 0.5-1 mm |\n| Diameter | Match rod OD (16 mm) |\n| Quantity | 2-3 rings per probe |\n| Minimum Spacing | 0.3 m between rings |\n\n: ERT ring electrode specifications. {#tbl-ert-ring}\n\n| Position | Distance from Tip |\n|----------|-------------------|\n| Ring A (Upper) | 0.5 m |\n| Ring B (Mid) | 1.5 m |\n| Ring C (Deep) | 2.5-3.0 m (optional) |\n\n: Standard ERT ring mounting positions. {#tbl-ert-positions}\n\n## Junction Box Design {#sec-junction-box}\n\nThe surface junction box serves as the termination point for all probe wiring. It contains no active electronics - only passive connections via a terminal block. This keeps the probe lightweight and simple while enabling field serviceability. All \"smart\" electronics reside in the central hub at the surface.\n\n\n\n| Dimension | Value |\n|-----------|-------|\n| Diameter | 25 mm |\n| Height | 35 mm |\n| Thread | Internal M12x1.75 (bottom) |\n| Material | PETG or ABS (weatherproof) |\n| Features | Terminal block mount, cable gland |\n\n: Surface junction box specifications. {#tbl-junction-box}\n\n## Probe Cross-Section Detail {#sec-probe-cross-section}\n\nThe complete probe assembly integrates all components into a unified 16mm OD profile. The cross-section reveals the internal arrangement of coils, ERT rings, threaded joints, and wiring passages. This dense packing enables full sensing capability while minimizing ground disturbance.\n\n\n\n## Manufacturing Procedures {#sec-manufacturing}\n\n## 3D Printing Guide {#sec-3d-printing}\n\nAll plastic components are designed for FDM 3D printing with specific settings optimized for thread quality and structural integrity. PETG or ASA material is required for impact resistance and UV stability. Critical: threads require post-processing with tap and die tools.\n\n\n\n| Setting | Value | Notes |\n|---------|-------|-------|\n| Material | PETG or ASA | Required for impact/UV |\n| Layer Height | 0.12mm | Critical for threads |\n| Infill | 100% (Solid) | Critical for strength |\n| Walls | 6 Loops | Solid threaded regions |\n| Supports | DISABLED | Use built-in scaffolding |\n| Speed | 50mm/s outer wall | Quality over speed |\n\n: Recommended 3D printer settings for probe components. {#tbl-print-settings}\n\n## Thread Post-Processing {#sec-thread-postprocessing}\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Thread Cutting Procedure\n\n- Male threads: Print at 12.2mm OD, cut with M12x1.75 Die\n- Female threads: Print at 10.5mm hole, cut with M12x1.75 Tap\n- Always use cutting oil to reduce friction\n- Cut slowly, back out frequently to clear chips\n- Test fit before epoxy assembly\n:::\n\n## Insertion Methods {#sec-mech-insertion-methods}\n\nFour primary insertion methods accommodate different soil conditions. Method selection depends on soil type, target depth, and available equipment. The pilot rod method requires complete removal of metal before measurements.\n\n\n\n## Assembly Sequence {#sec-assembly-sequence}\n\nProbe assembly follows a bottom-to-top sequence with all components screwing together via M12 threads. The modular design enables field assembly and allows replacement of individual segments without rebuilding the entire probe.\n\n\n\n## Advantages of Micro-Probe Design {#sec-mech-advantages}\n\n\n\nKey advantages of the micro-probe design include:\n\n- **Strength:** 16mm OD allows for robust M12 threads\n- **Modularity:** Sensor spacing determined by rod segment length\n- **Manufacturability:** Sensors built into printed parts, not glued onto rod\n- **Smooth Profile:** Flush connections prevent snagging during insertion/extraction\n- **Field Serviceable:** Replace individual segments without rebuilding entire probe\n- **Simpler Assembly:** No electronics in probe\n- **Lighter Weight:** ~50-100 g per meter (vs 200-250 g)\n- **Easier Insertion:** Smaller diameter, less force needed\n- **Lower Cost:** ~$40-60 per probe (vs $130-180)\n- **Better Reliability:** Passive probes more robust\n- **Minimal Intrusion:** ~10x less disturbance than 25mm design\n\n## References {#sec-mech-references}\n\n1.
