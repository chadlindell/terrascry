This section provides comprehensive guidance for safe and responsible operations, with particular emphasis on unexploded ordnance (UXO) site safety.\n\n## Human Remains Protocol {#sec-human-remains}\n\nHIRT surveys at sites potentially containing human remains must be treated as **forensic/archaeological contexts**. The following requirements apply:\n\n- Obtain all **permits and permissions** before deployment\n- Follow jurisdictional requirements (heritage boards, war graves authorities)\n- Maintain proper chain of custody for any findings\n- Document all activities thoroughly with photographs and written records\n- Coordinate with relevant authorities before, during, and after surveys\n\n## UXO Risk Assessment {#sec-uxo-risk}\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## CRITICAL WARNING\n\n- WWII sites can contain live ordnance\n- Standard insertion methodology is DANGEROUS at UXO sites\n- Never drive or hammer probes until area is cleared by qualified EOD/UXO professionals\n:::\n\n### Pre-Survey Requirements {#sec-pre-survey}\n\nBefore any HIRT deployment at a suspected UXO site, the following requirements must be satisfied:\n\n1. Coordinate with explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) teams\n2. Obtain professional EOD sweep clearance for the survey area\n3. Follow established UXO clearance protocols for the jurisdiction\n4. Maintain safe standoff distances during all operations\n5. Establish clear emergency evacuation procedures\n\n### Critical Problems with Standard Procedures {#sec-critical-problems}\n\nThe standard HIRT insertion methodology (\"drive pilot rod to depth, wiggle to 12-14 mm, remove\") presents unacceptable risks at UXO sites:\n\n- **Mechanical trigger risk:** Driving a steel rod into ground containing potential ordnance could trigger detonation\n- **No risk analysis:** Standard procedures lack risk analysis for probe insertion near UXB\n- **Electrical interaction:** ERT current injection (0.5-2 mA) could theoretically interact with sensitive fuzes\n- **Transient hazards:** No overvoltage protection specified (12V/0.5 ohm = 24A transient on short)\n\n::: {#cell-fig-safety-flowchart .cell fig-height='6' fig-width='8' execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![UXO site safety protocol decision flowchart. Each survey must complete all safety checks before proceeding with probe insertion.](19-ethics-legal-safety_files/figure-html/fig-safety-flowchart-output-1.png){#fig-safety-flowchart}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Required Safety Measures for UXO Sites {#sec-safety-measures}\n\n| Protocol | Action |\n|----------|--------|\n| Pre-survey EOD clearance | Professional EOD sweep before ANY insertion |\n| Safe standoff perimeter | Minimum 100m exclusion zone during insertion |\n| Soft insertion only | Hand auger or water-jet only (NO hammering) |\n| Conductivity pre-check | Check soil conductivity before deep insertion |\n| Personnel limits | Minimum personnel in hazard zone |\n| Communications | Constant radio contact with safe zone |\n\n: Required safety measures for UXO site operations {#tbl-safety-measures}\n\n## Conductivity Threshold Monitoring {#sec-conductivity-monitoring}\n\nResearch (Waga et al. 2026) indicates that conductivity >6,000 uS/cm at WWII bomb craters signals chemical activation risk, potentially leading to spontaneous explosions. HIRT's ERT-Lite system provides continuous conductivity monitoring capability.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-risk-matrix .cell fig-height='4' fig-width='8' execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Conductivity-based risk assessment matrix. Operations must halt immediately if conductivity exceeds 5,500 uS/cm.](19-ethics-legal-safety_files/figure-html/fig-risk-matrix-output-1.png){#fig-risk-matrix}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Safety Thresholds {#sec-safety-thresholds}\n\n| Conductivity | Status | Action |\n|--------------|--------|--------|\n| <3,000 uS/cm | GREEN (Safe) | Normal operations |\n| 3,000-5,500 uS/cm | YELLOW (Caution) | Increased monitoring, limit insertion depth |\n| >5,500 uS/cm | RED (Halt) | STOP all insertion, evacuate to safe zone, consult EOD |\n\n: Conductivity safety thresholds for UXO site operations {#tbl-conductivity-thresholds}\n\n### Time-Lapse Monitoring Schedule {#sec-monitoring-schedule}\n\nFor extended UXO site investigations, implement the following monitoring schedule:\n\n| Phase | Timing | Metrics | Action |\n|-------|--------|---------|--------|\n| Baseline | Day 0 | Full MIT + ERT survey | Establish reference values |\n| Early detection | Day 7-14 | Conductivity only | Alert if >10% change |\n| Long-term | Monthly | Full ERT | Track redox boundary evolution |\n| Pre-excavation | 24-48h before | Full survey | Final safety check |\n\n: Recommended time-lapse monitoring schedule for UXO sites {#tbl-monitoring-schedule}\n\n## Rim-Only Deployment {#sec-rim-deployment}\n\nFor craters with suspected UXB at center, deploy probes **around the perimeter only**. This approach maintains survey geometry while avoiding direct insertion over suspected ordnance.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-rim-deployment .cell fig-height='6' fig-width='6' execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Rim-only deployment pattern for high-risk craters. Probes are positioned around the perimeter, maintaining safe standoff from the central exclusion zone.](19-ethics-legal-safety_files/figure-html/fig-rim-deployment-output-1.png){#fig-rim-deployment}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## HIRT Early Warning Capability\n\n- Volumetric 3D resistivity (vs. single-point measurements)\n- Gradient detection identifies active redox boundaries\n- Non-magnetic operation safe near UXB\n- \"Set Once; Measure Many\" enables time-lapse without repeated insertion\n:::\n\n## Minimal Intrusion Principles {#sec-minimal-intrusion}\n\nHIRT operations should always prioritize minimal site disturbance. The following principles guide responsible deployment:\n\n- Prefer **rim/perimeter probing** over direct insertion into suspected areas\n- Use **shallow depths** when possible to achieve survey objectives\n- Employ **pilot holes** to minimize ground disturbance volume\n- **Avoid inserting probes into suspected burial voids** without explicit authorization\n- Document all probe insertion points and depths for site records\n\n## Field Safety Checklist {#sec-field-checklist}\n\nThe following checklist must be completed before commencing any HIRT survey at a UXO-suspected site. All critical items (marked with a star) are mandatory.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-safety-checklist .cell fig-height='5' fig-width='8' execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![UXO site safety checklist. All critical items (marked with star) must be verified before operations commence.](19-ethics-legal-safety_files/figure-html/fig-safety-checklist-output-1.png){#fig-safety-checklist}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## General Field Safety {#sec-general-safety}\n\nBeyond UXO-specific protocols, all HIRT field operations must adhere to general safety practices:\n\n- Maintain clear communication protocols between all team members\n- Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for site conditions\n- Have emergency contact information readily available and posted\n- Follow local environmental regulations for equipment deployment\n- Respect site boundaries and access restrictions at all times\n- Conduct daily equipment safety checks before deployment\n- Maintain first aid kit and emergency supplies on site\n\n## Summary: Recommended Protocol {#sec-protocol-summary}\n\nFor UXO sites requiring time-lapse monitoring, implement the following protocol:\n\n1. Baseline ERT survey of crater perimeter (Day 0)\n2. Weekly monitoring of conductivity trends\n3. Alert threshold set at >10% change from baseline\n4. Halt excavation immediately at >5,500 uS/cm\n5. Consult EOD team for any anomalous readings\n\n## References {#sec-ethics-references .unnumbered}\n\n1. OSCE Guidelines for Humanitarian Demining Operations (2024).
