Effective interpretation requires understanding both the physics of the measurements and the geological/archaeological context of the survey site.\n\n## Data Processing Pipeline {#sec-processing-pipeline}\n\nHIRT data processing follows a systematic pipeline from raw field acquisition through final interpretation. Each stage validates and refines the data to produce reliable subsurface images.\n\n\n\n## Processing Stages\n\n1. **Data Acquisition:** Raw ADC samples collected from probe pairs\n2. **Filter and Average:** Noise reduction through digital filtering and stacking\n3. **Background Removal:** Subtract homogeneous response to isolate anomalies\n4. **Reciprocity Check:** Validate A-to-B equals B-to-A for quality assurance\n5. **Tomographic Inversion:** Reconstruct 3D conductivity/resistivity distribution\n6. **MIT/ERT Fusion:** Combine multi-modal data for comprehensive interpretation\n7. **3D Model Generation:** Build voxel grid from inverted data\n8. **Visualization:** Generate depth slices, isosurfaces, and reports\n\n## Depth of Investigation {#sec-depth-investigation}\n\nThe achievable investigation depth depends on several factors including probe depth, probe spacing, soil conductivity, and measurement frequency. Understanding these relationships is essential for survey planning and result interpretation.\n\n## Factors Affecting Depth\n\n- **Probe depth:** Deeper insertion enables deeper sensitivity\n- **Probe spacing:** Wider spacing increases depth but reduces lateral resolution\n- **Soil conductivity:** Lower conductivity enables deeper signal penetration\n- **Frequency (MIT):** Lower frequency provides deeper sensitivity\n- **Current geometry (ERT):** Longer baselines enable deeper investigation\n\n| Configuration | MIT Depth | ERT Depth | Combined | Confidence |\n|---------------|-----------|-----------|----------|------------|\n| 1.5m probes, 1.5m spacing | 1.5-2.5m | 2-3m | 2-3m | HIGH |\n| 1.5m probes, 2.0m spacing | 2-3m | 2-3m | 2-3m | HIGH |\n| 3.0m probes, 2.0m spacing | 3-4m | 3-5m | 3-5m | MEDIUM |\n| 3.0m probes, 2.5m spacing | 3-4m | 4-6m | 4-6m | LOW |\n\n: Depth of investigation by configuration {#tbl-depth-investigation}\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThe commonly cited '3-6m' depth range represents favorable conditions only. For most field conditions, expect 2-4m typical depth, with up to 5-6m achievable in optimal soil conditions with longer probes and wider spacing.\n:::\n\n## Lateral Resolution {#sec-lateral-resolution}\n\nLateral resolution approximately equals 0.5 to 1.5 times the probe spacing. Tighter spacing provides finer resolution but requires more survey time, while wider spacing offers faster coverage with coarser resolution.\n\n| Spacing | Lateral Resolution | Best Application |\n|---------|-------------------|------------------|\n| 1.0 m | 0.5-1.5 m | High-resolution burial/artifact search |\n| 1.5 m | 0.75-2.25 m | Standard WWII crash investigation |\n| 2.0 m | 1.0-3.0 m | Large feature reconnaissance |\n\n: Resolution by probe spacing {#tbl-resolution}\n\n## HIRT vs Surface Methods {#sec-hirt-vs-surface}\n\nHIRT's crosshole geometry provides 2-5 times better resolution than surface methods at depths greater than 2m. This advantage increases with depth due to direct ray paths and elimination of surface clutter.\n\n| Method | Lateral Res. | Depth Res. | At 3m Depth |\n|--------|--------------|------------|-------------|\n| Surface Magnetometry | 1-2m | Poor | ~2m lateral |\n| GPR (in sand) | 0.3-0.5m | 0.05-0.1m | Degrades to 1m+ |\n| GPR (in clay) | Limited | Limited | Often fails |\n| Surface ERT (Wenner) | ~1x spacing | ~0.5x spacing | ~2-3m |\n| HIRT (1.5m spacing) | 0.75-1.5m | 0.5-0.75m | ~1m lateral |\n| HIRT (2m spacing) | 1-2m | 0.5-1m | ~1.5m lateral |\n\n: Resolution comparison: HIRT vs surface methods {#tbl-method-comparison}\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Why HIRT Achieves Better Resolution\n\n- Direct ray paths through target volume (not down-and-back)\n- No surface clutter from topography and cultural noise\n- True 3D sampling enables genuine tomographic reconstruction\n- Better depth discrimination between targets at different depths\n:::\n\n## Anomaly Classification {#sec-anomaly-classification}\n\nMIT and ERT respond differently to various subsurface features. Understanding these response characteristics enables accurate classification of detected anomalies.\n\n\n\n## MIT (Magneto-Inductive Tomography) Detection\n\n- **Metal objects:** Strong response to aluminum, steel, and iron\n- **Conductive regions:** Moderate response to saline water, clay layers\n- **Eddy current anomalies:** Metallic wreckage produces characteristic signatures\n- Phase lag indicates conductivity; amplitude indicates size/distance\n- Higher frequencies provide better near-surface sensitivity\n\n## ERT (Electrical Resistivity) Detection\n\n- **Disturbed fill:** Different compaction and moisture than native soil\n- **Moisture variations:** Wet zones appear as low resistivity\n- **Crater walls:** Clear boundaries between fill and native soil\n- **Voids:** Air-filled spaces show very high resistivity\n- Depth slices reveal layering and lateral extent of features\n\n## Example Tomogram Interpretation {#sec-example-tomogram}\n\nThe following example demonstrates combined MIT and ERT interpretation for a simulated WWII crash site investigation. Note how the complementary data streams provide more complete subsurface characterization than either method alone.\n\n\n\n## Interpretation Notes\n\n- MIT clearly identifies the metal concentration at 2.5m depth\n- ERT reveals the crater fill geometry and moisture distribution\n- Combined view shows the target context within disturbed ground\n- High-priority designation indicates both metal and disturbed fill present\n\n## Combined Interpretation Strategy {#sec-combined-strategy}\n\nEffective HIRT interpretation combines MIT and ERT results with site context and historical information. The following decision tree provides systematic guidance for prioritizing investigation targets.\n\n\n\n## Example Interpretation Scenarios\n\n### Scenario 1: Bomb Crater Investigation\n\n- **MIT:** Metal parts detected near crater base (aluminum/steel fragments)\n- **ERT:** Fill bowl geometry visible, wet pockets at base, clear crater walls\n- **Interpretation:** Classic impact crater with retained metallic debris\n\n### Scenario 2: Woods Burial Search\n\n- **MIT:** Small metallic clusters (buckles, dog tags, buttons)\n- **ERT:** Rectangular disturbed zone with different moisture profile\n- **Interpretation:** Possible grave shaft requiring careful investigation\n\n### Scenario 3: Aircraft Wreckage\n\n- **MIT:** Large conductive masses (engine block, landing gear)\n- **ERT:** Disturbed ground pattern, possible fuel contamination zones\n- **Interpretation:** Significant wreckage concentration warranting excavation\n\n## Data Quality Indicators {#sec-quality-indicators}\n\n## Good Data Characteristics\n\n- Consistent reciprocity (A-to-B approximately equals B-to-A)\n- Smooth spatial variations without erratic jumps\n- Expected depth sensitivity matching configuration\n- Stable baseline measurements over survey duration\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Problematic Data Warning Signs\n\n- Poor reciprocity indicates coupling problems or calibration drift\n- Noisy/spiky readings suggest connection issues or EMI\n- No depth sensitivity may indicate inadequate spacing or frequency\n- Inconsistent repeats require checking timebase and connectors\n:::\n\n## Field Expectations and Detection Limits {#sec-detection-limits}\n\n## Typical Anomaly Sizes\n\n| Target Type | Typical Size | Expected Response |\n|-------------|--------------|-------------------|\n| Large metal (engine) | 1-3 m | Strong MIT response |\n| Small metal (artifacts) | 0.1-0.5 m | Weaker MIT, requires tight spacing |\n| Grave shaft | 0.5-1.5 m wide | Clear ERT contrast |\n| Crater fill | 10-15 m diameter | ERT shows boundaries clearly |\n\n: Typical anomaly sizes and expected responses {#tbl-anomaly-sizes}\n\n## Detection Limits\n\n- **MIT:** Can detect ~0.1m metal at 1-2m depth (size dependent)\n- **ERT:** Can resolve ~0.5m features at 1-2m depth\n- **Depth:** Practical limit 2-4m typical with 3m probes (5-6m in optimal conditions)\n\n## Post-Survey Workflow {#sec-post-survey}\n\n1. **QA/QC:** Verify data quality and reciprocity\n2. **Inversion:** Reconstruct 3D models using appropriate algorithms\n3. **Fusion:** Combine MIT and ERT results for complete picture\n4. **Visualization:** Generate depth slices and 3D isosurfaces\n5. **Interpretation:** Correlate anomalies with site context\n6. **Reporting:** Document findings with confidence assessments\n7. **Planning:** Recommend excavation priorities and methods\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Key Interpretation Principles\n\n- Always combine MIT and ERT for complete subsurface picture\n- Consider site history and expected target characteristics\n- Use confidence levels to guide excavation prioritization\n- Document interpretation rationale for future reference\n:::\n\n## Mathematical Basis of Reconstruction {#sec-math-basis}\n\nFor scientific rigor, it is important to define the physical models governing the reconstruction algorithms. The inversion process solves the 'inverse problem': finding the subsurface property distribution that best explains the measured data.\n\n## Forward Models\n\n**MIT (Quasi-Static Maxwell's Equations):** The secondary magnetic field B_s generated by eddy currents in a conductive medium is governed by:\n\n$$\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -i \\omega \\mathbf{B}$$\n\n$$\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} = \\sigma \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{J}_s$$\n\nWhere $\\sigma$ is conductivity, $\\omega$ is angular frequency, and $\\mathbf{J}_s$ is the source current.\n\n**ERT (Poisson's Equation):** The electric potential $\\phi$ distribution due to a current source $I$ in a medium of conductivity $\\sigma$ is governed by:\n\n$$\\nabla \\cdot (\\sigma \\nabla \\phi) = -I \\delta(\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}_s)$$\n\n## Inverse Problem Formulation\n\nThe reconstruction minimizes an objective function $\\Phi$ comprising data mismatch and model roughness (regularization):\n\n$$\\Phi(\\mathbf{m}) = \\| \\mathbf{d}_{obs} - F(\\mathbf{m}) \\|^2 + \\lambda \\| \\mathbf{R} \\mathbf{m} \\|^2$$\n\nWhere $\\mathbf{d}_{obs}$ is observed data, $F(\\mathbf{m})$ is the forward model output for model $\\mathbf{m}$, $\\mathbf{R}$ is the roughness matrix, and $\\lambda$ is the regularization parameter. This is typically solved using a Gauss-Newton iterative update:\n\n$$\\mathbf{m}_{k+1} = \\mathbf{m}_k - (\\mathbf{J}^T \\mathbf{J} + \\lambda \\mathbf{R}^T \\mathbf{R})^{-1} \\mathbf{J}^T (\\mathbf{d}_{obs} - F(\\mathbf{m}_k))$$\n\nWhere $\\mathbf{J}$ is the Sensitivity Matrix (Jacobian) describing how data changes with model parameters.\n\n",
