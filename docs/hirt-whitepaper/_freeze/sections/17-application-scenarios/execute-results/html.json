This section provides detailed configuration recommendations for three primary application categories: bomb crater investigation, woodland burial search, and wetland/margin surveys. Each scenario requires specific probe lengths, spacing, frequency selection, and deployment strategies to maximize detection probability while maintaining operational safety.\n\nConfiguration selection depends on several key factors: target depth, soil conditions, site access constraints, and the nature of expected anomalies. The dual-channel MIT+ERT approach provides complementary information: MIT excels at detecting metallic objects (both ferrous and non-ferrous), while ERT maps soil disturbance patterns, moisture variations, and void structures.\n\n## Scenario 1: Bomb Crater Investigation {#sec-bomb-crater}\n\nBomb crater investigation represents the most demanding HIRT application, requiring deep penetration (3-4+ meters), comprehensive coverage of disturbed fill material, and detection of potentially large metallic masses. Typical crater dimensions range from 10-15 meters diameter with depths of 2-4 meters.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-bomb-crater .cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Bomb crater investigation configuration showing perimeter probe deployment around crater margin. Six 3.5m probes at 2m spacing provide comprehensive coverage through crater fill. MIT ray paths (green) interrogate the full volume including potential UXB location at crater base. ERT rings map fill boundaries and wet zones.](17-application-scenarios_files/figure-html/fig-bomb-crater-output-1.png){#fig-bomb-crater}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Configuration Parameters\n\n- **Rod Length:** 3.0 m (minimum; 3.5m preferred for full-depth coverage)\n- **ERT Ring Positions:** 0.5 m, 1.5 m, 2.5 m from probe tip\n- **Probe Spacing:** 1.5-2 m between probes\n- **Section Size:** Covers full crater plus rim (may require multiple sections)\n- **Probe Count:** 20-36 probes depending on crater dimensions\n\n### Measurement Strategy\n\n- **MIT Emphasis:** 2-20 kHz frequency range for aluminum/steel mass detection\n- **ERT Focus:** Map fill bowl geometry and identify wet pockets\n- **Depth Target:** 0-4+ meters (full crater depth plus underlying zone)\n- **Frequency Selection:** Lower frequencies (2-5 kHz) for maximum penetration\n- **Integration Time:** 10-30 seconds per measurement for improved SNR at depth\n\n### Deployment Considerations\n\nCrater investigation presents unique challenges including uneven surface topography, loose fill material, and potential UXO hazards. Initial deployment should focus on the crater rim where stable soil provides secure probe anchoring.\n\n- **Rim-First Approach:** Deploy perimeter probes before attempting center insertion\n- **Multiple Overlapping Sections:** Large craters may require 2-3 overlapping arrays\n- **Deep Insertion Protocol:** Use pilot rods to verify probe path before full insertion\n- **Extended Baselines:** ERT corner-to-corner measurements for deep investigation\n\n### Expected Results\n\nMIT measurements will show strong amplitude and phase anomalies from large metallic objects (engine blocks, landing gear, ordnance casings). ERT will map the crater boundary as a resistivity contrast between disturbed fill and native soil. Water accumulation at the crater base appears as low resistivity zones.\n\n## Scenario 2: Woodland Burials {#sec-woodland-burial}\n\nWoodland burial search requires high-resolution detection of relatively shallow targets (0.5-2 m depth) in environments complicated by root systems and organic material. The primary detection mechanism is ERT mapping of disturbed soil zones (grave shafts), supplemented by MIT detection of metallic artifacts.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-woodland-burial .cell execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Woodland burial site configuration showing dense probe array (7 probes, 1m spacing) for shallow target detection. Disturbed soil zone (grave shaft) shows distinct ERT contrast. Tree root systems require careful probe positioning. MIT detects small metallic artifacts (buckles, buttons) within burial context.](17-application-scenarios_files/figure-html/fig-woodland-burial-output-1.png){#fig-woodland-burial}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Configuration Parameters\n\n- **Rod Length:** 1.6 m (sufficient for typical burial depths)\n- **ERT Ring Positions:** 0.4 m and 1.2 m from probe tip\n- **Probe Spacing:** 1-1.5 m (tight spacing for small targets)\n- **Section Size:** 8x8 m standard search area\n- **Probe Count:** 12-16 probes for comprehensive coverage\n\n### Measurement Strategy\n\n- **ERT Emphasis:** Primary method for grave shaft detection\n- **MIT Frequencies:** 5-20 kHz range (focus on small metallic artifacts)\n- **Target Signatures:** Clusters of small anomalies suggest artifact concentrations\n- **Depth Target:** 0-2 m (standard burial depth range)\n- **Multiple Frequencies:** Sweep 5, 10, 20 kHz for sensitivity optimization\n\n### Deployment Considerations\n\nWoodland environments require sensitivity to site preservation. Use shallow insertion where possible and avoid major root systems. Document all surface features that may correlate with subsurface anomalies.\n\n- **Minimal Intrusion:** Shallow insertion protocol, narrow pilot holes\n- **Root Avoidance:** Survey root positions before probe placement\n- **Dense Measurement Pattern:** Short baselines for maximum near-surface resolution\n- **Complementary Methods:** Coordinate with GPR surface survey if available\n\n## Scenario 3: Swamp/Wetland Margins {#sec-swamp-margin}\n\nWetland and swamp margin surveys address the challenge of deep targets (>5 m) in areas with limited access. Probes must be deployed from accessible shore zones, using extended baselines to interrogate central volumes that cannot be directly instrumented.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-swamp-margin .cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Swamp/margin survey configuration showing shore-based probe deployment. Probes on opposing banks create diagonal ray paths through target volume beneath water body. Low-frequency MIT (2-5 kHz) provides deep penetration. Extended baselines enable detection of targets beyond direct probe reach.](17-application-scenarios_files/figure-html/fig-swamp-margin-output-1.png){#fig-swamp-margin}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Configuration Parameters\n\n- **Rod Length:** Maximum feasible at margins (typically 1.5-2 m)\n- **Probe Spacing:** 2-3 m (wider for challenging access)\n- **Section Size:** Adapts to accessible areas\n- **Probe Count:** Variable based on margin accessibility\n- **Baseline Length:** Maximize TX-RX separation for depth penetration\n\n### Measurement Strategy\n\n- **Low MIT Frequencies:** 2-5 kHz for maximum depth penetration\n- **Extended Offsets:** Long TX-RX baselines essential for deep targets\n- **ERT Configuration:** Wide injection pairs across water if possible\n- **Shore-Based Probes:** Deploy from accessible margins only\n- **Complementary Methods:** Consider seismic add-on for void detection\n\n### Deployment Considerations\n\nSafety is paramount in wetland environments. Ensure stable footing, assess water depth, and use appropriate personal protective equipment. The high conductivity of water affects both MIT and ERT measurements, requiring adjusted interpretation parameters.\n\n- **Access Limitations:** Work strictly from stable shore positions\n- **Water Effects:** Account for high conductivity in data interpretation\n- **Extended Integration:** Longer measurement times for weak signals\n- **Marginal Detection:** Targets near detection limits require repeated measurements\n\n## Scenario Comparison Matrix {#sec-scenario-comparison}\n\nThe following comparison summarizes key configuration parameters across all three primary scenarios. Selection depends on target depth, soil conditions, and site access constraints.\n\n| Scenario | Rod Length | Spacing | Frequencies | Depth Target | Key Method |\n|----------|------------|---------|-------------|--------------|------------|\n| Woods Burials | 1.6 m | 1-1.5 m | 5-20 kHz | 0-2 m | ERT + MIT |\n| Bomb Crater | 3.0 m | 1.5-2 m | 2-20 kHz | 0-4+ m | MIT + ERT |\n| Swamp/Margins | 1.5-2 m | 2-3 m | 2-5 kHz | >5 m | Low-freq MIT |\n\n: Summary of configuration parameters by application scenario {#tbl-config-comparison}\n\n## Target Characterization {#sec-target-characterization}\n\nUnderstanding expected response patterns helps operators identify and classify anomalies during field operations. The dual-channel MIT+ERT approach provides complementary signatures for different target types.\n\n### Interpretation Guidelines\n\n- **Strong MIT + ERT Contrast:** Large metallic object in disturbed context (e.g., UXB in crater)\n- **MIT Only:** Metal object in undisturbed native soil\n- **ERT Only:** Soil disturbance without metallic content (possible burial, cache)\n- **Weak MIT Cluster:** Multiple small metallic artifacts (artifact scatter)\n- **Low ERT Zone:** Water accumulation, saturated fill\n- **High ERT Zone:** Air void, dry compacted material\n\n## Site Assessment and Configuration Selection {#sec-site-assessment}\n\nProper site assessment is essential for selecting optimal configuration parameters. The decision flow considers target depth, access conditions, soil type, and safety requirements.\n\n### Pre-Deployment Checklist\n\n1. Conduct site safety assessment (UXO clearance if applicable)\n2. Estimate target depth range from historical records or surface features\n3. Evaluate access conditions and identify probe deployment zones\n4. Assess soil type and expected conductivity\n5. Determine required spatial resolution for target detection\n6. Select configuration parameters from scenario guidelines\n7. Plan grid layout and probe numbering scheme\n8. Verify all equipment functionality before deployment\n\n## General Field Procedures {#sec-field-procedures}\n\n### Pre-Deployment\n\n- **Site Assessment:** Evaluate access, safety, and estimated target depth\n- **Configuration Selection:** Choose rod length, spacing, and frequencies per scenario\n- **Grid Planning:** Lay out probe positions with consistent numbering\n- **Equipment Check:** Verify all probes, base hub, tools, and cables\n\n### During Deployment\n\n- **Systematic Approach:** Follow 'set once, measure many' workflow\n- **Quality Control:** Check reciprocity, repeat critical measurements\n- **Documentation:** Record all conditions, anomalies, and deviations\n- **Adaptation:** Adjust strategy based on initial results if necessary\n\n### Post-Deployment\n\n- **Data Backup:** Secure all data immediately upon completion\n- **Quick Analysis:** Generate preliminary plots to verify data quality\n- **Equipment Care:** Clean, inspect, and repair probes as needed\n- **Documentation:** Complete field notes and measurement logs\n\n## Cost and Timeline Planning {#sec-cost-timeline}\n\nPlanning a HIRT deployment requires realistic assessment of equipment costs and build timeline. The following estimates assume standard components and moderate fabrication experience.\n\n| Component | Essential (12 probes) | Standard (20 probes) | Complete (24 probes) |\n|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Probes | $840-1,800 | $1,400-3,000 | $1,680-3,600 |\n| Base Hub | $200-500 | $200-500 | $200-500 |\n| Tools/Supplies | $200-400 | $200-400 | $200-400 |\n| **Total** | **$1,200-2,700** | **$1,800-3,900** | **$2,100-4,500** |\n\n: Estimated costs for HIRT system configurations. Actual costs vary by supplier, quantity discounts, and component choices. {#tbl-cost-estimate}\n\n### Build Timeline\n\n- **Week 1-2 (Prototype):** Build 2 prototype probes, document procedures\n- **Week 3 (Calibration):** Bench calibration, test target trials, design refinement\n- **Week 4-5 (Scale-up):** Build 12-20 probes, assemble base hub, field shakedown\n- **Week 6+ (Deployment):** First real section scans, procedure refinement\n\n## Recommendations {#sec-recommendations}\n\n### Start Simple\n\nBegin with the core MIT+ERT system on controlled test sites before attempting operational deployments. Build experience with probe handling, measurement protocols, and data interpretation before addressing complex field scenarios.\n\n### Add Selectively\n\nOptional enhancements (borehole radar, seismic crosshole, magnetometer sweep) should be added based on demonstrated need rather than theoretical benefit. Each addition increases system complexity and field deployment time.\n\n### Maintain Modularity\n\nThe modular probe design enables component replacement and configuration adaptation. Maintain this modularity by documenting all modifications and ensuring backward compatibility with existing components.\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Critical: UXO Site Safety\n\n- Professional EOD clearance required before ANY probe insertion at suspected UXO sites\n- Never hammer or drive probes - use soft insertion only\n- Maintain appropriate exclusion zones during all operations\n- Monitor groundwater conductivity - elevated levels may indicate corrosion risk\n- Document all anomalies for EOD follow-up before excavation\n:::\n\n",
