The next phase involves **software development** for data processing, inversion, and visualization, as well as continued hardware improvements.\n\nThe software development is **explicitly separate** from the hardware/field guide presented in this document. The hardware system is designed to collect high-quality data that can be processed with standard or custom software tools.\n\n## Development Roadmap {#sec-development-roadmap}\n\nThe HIRT project follows a phased development approach, with parallel tracks for software and hardware improvements.
