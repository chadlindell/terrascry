The HIRT system combines Magnetic Induction Tomography (MIT) and Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) measurements using a modular array of subsurface probes to achieve high-resolution imaging of buried targets.\n\n## Pre-Deployment Planning {#sec-pre-deployment}\n\n### Site Assessment (Day Before)\n\nThorough preparation is critical to successful field operations. Before deployment, conduct a comprehensive site assessment covering the following aspects:\n\n1. **Review site conditions:** Evaluate soil type and moisture levels, identify presence of utilities or obstructions, and establish access routes and staging areas.\n2. **Check equipment:** Verify all probes are tested and calibrated, ensure base hub battery is charged (>80%), verify cable continuity, and confirm data logger/tablet is configured.\n3. **Verify permits and permissions:** Confirm site access authorization, excavation permits (if required), and archaeological survey approval.\n\n### Equipment Checklist\n\n| Category | Item | Quantity | Notes |\n|----------|------|----------|-------|\n| Essential | Probes (tested) | 20-24 | Full functional test |\n| Essential | Base hub/control unit | 1 | Battery >80% |\n| Essential | Connection cables | 3-5 m each | Verified continuity |\n| Essential | Fiberglass survey stakes | As needed | For marking |\n| Essential | Measuring tape | 30 m min | Metric markings |\n| Essential | Field tablet/laptop | 1 | Configured with software |\n| Essential | Tool kit | 1 | Wrenches, screwdrivers, multimeter |\n| Optional | GPS unit | 1 | Sub-meter accuracy preferred |\n| Optional | Weather station | 1 | Temperature, humidity |\n| Optional | Backup battery | 1 | 12V compatible |\n\n: Field equipment checklist for HIRT deployment {#tbl-equipment-checklist}\n\n## Site Assessment and Grid Design {#sec-grid-design}\n\nGrid design is fundamental to survey success. The grid geometry determines spatial resolution, depth sensitivity, and survey efficiency. Standard configurations are provided below, with adjustments based on site-specific requirements.\n\n| Configuration | Grid Size | Spacing | Probes | Application |\n|---------------|-----------|---------|--------|-------------|\n| Standard | 10 x 10 m | 2.0 m | 20-24 | General surveys |\n| Small | 8 x 8 m | 1.5 m | 12-16 | Woodland/confined areas |\n| Large | 15 x 15 m | 2.5 m | 30-36 | Crater sites, open areas |\n| High Resolution | 6 x 6 m | 1.0 m | 36 | Detailed anomaly mapping |\n\n: Standard grid configurations for different survey scenarios {#tbl-grid-configs}\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Standard 10x10 m grid layout with 2 m probe spacing showing zone groupings for sequential deployment. Probes are numbered 1-25 in row-major order.](10-field-operations_files/figure-pdf/fig-grid-layout-output-1.png){#fig-grid-layout}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Grid Setup Steps\n\n1. **Establish baseline:** Set reference point (0,0) with survey stake, align baseline with site grid (N-S or as specified), and mark corners with bright flags.\n2. **Mark probe positions:** Measure spacing intervals along baseline, extend perpendicular rows, and mark each position with small stake or flag.\n3. **Verify geometry:** Cross-measure diagonals (should match within 5 cm) and record any deviations in field notes.\n\n## Probe Installation {#sec-probe-installation}\n\nProper probe installation is critical for obtaining quality data. Insertion depth and technique vary with soil conditions and target depth requirements.\n\n| Scenario | Target Depth | Insertion Depth | Notes |\n|----------|--------------|-----------------|-------|\n| Woodland survey | 1-2 m | 1.5 m | Standard for shallow targets |\n| Crater survey | 2-4 m | 3.0 m | Extended depth for crater fill |\n| Reconnaissance | 0.5-1 m | 1.0 m | Rapid screening mode |\n\n: Recommended insertion depths by survey scenario {#tbl-insertion-depths}\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Probe insertion procedure showing the four-step process: (1) pilot hole creation with hand auger, (2) first segment insertion, (3) segment connection at thread joint, and (4) completed installation with junction box and cable routing.](10-field-operations_files/figure-pdf/fig-insertion-procedure-output-1.png){#fig-insertion-procedure}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Soil type insertion decision tree.

This approach maximizes data quality and enables redundancy checks while minimizing handling of deployed equipment.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=7}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Complete field survey workflow showing four phases: Planning (site reconnaissance, grid design, equipment check), Deployment (marking, insertion, cabling), Acquisition (system test, survey execution, QC checks), and Recovery (backup, extraction, restoration).](10-field-operations_files/figure-pdf/fig-survey-workflow-output-1.png){#fig-survey-workflow}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Workflow Steps\n\n1. **Install All Probes:** Deploy complete array, mark with numbered flags, record GPS coordinates and insertion depths.\n2. **Background Scan:** Perform short MIT and ERT scan outside suspected zone to establish baseline/control measurements.\n3. **MIT Sweep:** Complete full TX-RX matrix at all frequencies before moving probes.\n4. **ERT Patterns:** Execute all injection patterns with multiple baselines for redundancy.\n5. **Quality Control:** Repeat 5-10% of TX-RX pairs, verify reciprocity (A-B approximately equals B-A), document any anomalies.\n6. **Extract and Move:** Carefully extract probes, shift to next section with one-column overlap for data continuity.\n\n## Quality Checks {#sec-field-quality-checks}\n\nReal-time quality assessment during data acquisition prevents costly re-surveys. Monitor the following indicators throughout the measurement process:\n\n### Good Data Indicators\n\n- Consistent reciprocity: TX(A)-RX(B) matches TX(B)-RX(A) within 5%\n- Smooth spatial variations without abrupt discontinuities\n- Expected depth sensitivity decay with increasing offset\n- Stable baseline measurements throughout survey\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Problematic Data Indicators\n\n- Poor reciprocity (>10% difference) - check coupling, recalibrate\n- Noisy/spiky readings - check connections, improve shielding\n- No depth sensitivity - verify spacing, adjust frequency\n- Inconsistent repeats - check timebase synchronization, connector integrity\n:::\n\n## Deployment Scenarios {#sec-deployment-scenarios}\n\nDifferent site conditions require adapted deployment strategies. The following scenarios illustrate common configurations optimized for specific survey objectives.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=8}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Deployment scenario configurations.
