## Overview

HIRT is open-source scientific hardware, and we welcome contributions from researchers, engineers, and practitioners. This guide explains how to contribute effectively to the project.

## Ways to Contribute

### Documentation

- Fix typos, clarify explanations, improve examples
- Add case studies from your field deployments
- Translate documentation for other languages
- Create tutorials for specific use cases

### Hardware Design

- Propose improvements to mechanical design
- Suggest component alternatives or upgrades
- Share modifications that work well in specific environments
- Document build experiences and lessons learned

### Software and Firmware

- Improve data processing algorithms
- Add features to acquisition software
- Develop inversion workflow tools
- Create visualization utilities

### Testing and Validation

- Share field validation data
- Report performance in different soil conditions
- Document edge cases and failure modes
- Provide comparison data with other methods

## Getting Started

### 1. Familiarize Yourself with the Project

- Read through the [Technical Manual](../index.qmd)
- Understand the [Theory](../theory/physics.qmd) behind HIRT
- Review the current [Roadmap](roadmap.qmd)

### 2. Set Up Your Development Environment

For documentation contributions:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hirt-project/hirt.git
cd hirt

# Install Quarto (documentation system)
# See: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/

# Preview documentation locally
cd docs
quarto preview
```

For firmware contributions:

```bash
# Install PlatformIO or Arduino IDE
# See firmware/README.md for specific requirements
```

### 3. Find Something to Work On

- Check the issue tracker for open issues
- Look for issues tagged "good first issue" or "help wanted"
- Review the [Roadmap](roadmap.qmd) for planned features

## Contribution Workflow

### For Documentation

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Create a branch** for your changes: `git checkout -b docs/improve-calibration-section`
3. **Make your changes** following the style guide
4. **Test locally** with `quarto preview`
5. **Commit** with a clear message
6. **Push** to your fork
7. **Open a Pull Request** with description of changes

### For Code/Firmware

1. **Open an issue first** to discuss your proposed change
2. **Fork** the repository
3. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/add-temperature-compensation`
4. **Write tests** for new functionality
5. **Ensure existing tests pass**
6. **Document** your changes
7. **Open a Pull Request**

## Style Guidelines

### Documentation Style

Follow the conventions in [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md):

- **Narrative prose** for theory and explanations
- **Lists and tables** for procedures and quick reference
- **Active voice** preferred
- **Present tense** for describing how things work
- **First person plural** ("We selected...") for design decisions

### Code Style

- Use consistent indentation (spaces, not tabs)
- Include meaningful comments for complex logic
- Follow existing naming conventions in the codebase
- Keep functions focused and well-documented

### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
Good: "Add temperature compensation to ERT channel calibration"
Bad:  "Fixed stuff"
```

For larger changes, use the format:

```
Short summary (50 chars or less)

More detailed explanation if needed. Wrap at 72 characters.
Explain what and why, not how (the code shows how).

- Bullet points are fine
- Reference issues: Fixes #123
```

## Reporting Issues

When reporting a bug or problem:

1. **Search existing issues** first to avoid duplicates
2. **Use the issue template** if provided
3. Include:
   - Clear description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs. actual behavior
   - System details (hardware version, firmware version, soil conditions)
   - Relevant data files or screenshots

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on the technical merits
- Welcome newcomers
- Acknowledge contributions from others

## Recognition

Contributors are recognized in:

- The project README
- Release notes for significant contributions
- Academic publications when appropriate (with permission)

## Questions?

- Open a discussion on GitHub Discussions
- Tag your issue with "question" for general inquiries
- For sensitive matters, contact the maintainers directly

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same license as the project (see repository for details).
