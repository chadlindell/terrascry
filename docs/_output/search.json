    "section": "2.2 Why the Name",
    "text": "2.2 Why the Name\nHIRT was created in a landscape shaped by war and unfinished consequences.\nThe Silesian basin of modern-day Poland was the target of one of the most intensive Allied bombing campaigns of World War II, centered on the Blechhammer industrial complex. Tens of thousands of bombs fell here. Many exploded. Thousands did not. Today, an estimated 4,000–6,000 unexploded bombs remain buried beneath forests, wetlands, and towns, still capable of detonation decades later. These UXOs continue to shape land use, infrastructure planning, and public safety across the region.\nThis same ground holds other histories. POW camps and forced labor sites. Jewish victims of the industrial death system tied to Blechhammer. Aircrews lost in the bombing campaigns. Civilians—families and children—killed not as targets, but by proximity. After the war came displacement, silence, and redevelopment layered over danger that was never fully removed.\nMy great-uncle, 1st Lt. Arthur Lindell, was shot down here. He and his crew are still missing, believed to lie in a filled bomb crater at the crash site. That search is personal—but it exists within a much larger, unresolved problem shared by communities across Europe and beyond.\nHIRT takes its name from this history of hurt and pain, and from a commitment to address what remains beneath the surface. It was designed to see without excavation, to reduce risk where danger still exists, and to help bring clarity—whether the goal is safety, remembrance, or recovery.",

This architecture offers cost and reliability advantages but requires attention to cable length effects on MIT receive signals, which operate in the microvolt range.\nThe Signal Integrity Challenge: MIT RX coils produce signals of approximately 1 µV at the probe. These signals must travel through the probe cable (3-5 m) and trunk cable (variable length to hub) before reaching the preamplifier. Cable capacitance creates a low-pass filter effect, and longer cables increase susceptibility to electromagnetic interference (EMI) pickup.\n\n\n\nTable 5.4: Cable length impact on MIT signal integrity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrunk Cable Length\nSignal Degradation\nEMI Susceptibility\nRecommendation\n\n\n\n\n&lt;5 m\n&lt;10%\nLow\nPassive probes OK\n\n\n5-10 m\n10-25%\nModerate\nPassive probes OK with shielding\n\n\n10-15 m\n25-40%\nHigh\nConsider active probe option\n\n\n&gt;15 m\n&gt;40%\nVery High\nActive probes recommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCable Capacitance Effect: Typical shielded cable has capacitance of approximately 100 pF/m. A 20 m cable run creates ~2 nF capacitive load. At 20 kHz operating frequency, this represents an impedance of ~4 k-ohm—significant for microvolt-level signals driving typical coil source impedances.\nPractical Guidelines:\n\nStandard deployments (10 m total cable run): Passive probes provide adequate SNR with no additional measures beyond standard shielded cable\nExtended deployments (10-15 m): Use low-capacitance cable, minimize parallel cable runs, ensure single-point shield grounding\nLarge-area surveys (&gt;15 m): Consider the optional active probe configuration (adds $50-80/probe) which places a unity-gain buffer at the probe, driving the cable with a low-impedance source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField Tip: Testing Cable Length Impact\n\n\n\nBefore committing to a large deployment, verify acceptable SNR at your planned cable lengths. Set up a single probe at the maximum expected distance from the hub and measure noise floor with TX disabled. If the noise exceeds 500 nV RMS, consider active probes or repositioning the hub closer to the probe array.",

    "title": "5  Deployment",
    "section": "5.5 Cable Management and Field Logistics",
    "text": "5.5 Cable Management and Field Logistics\nManaging cable harnesses for 16-24 probes in field conditions represents one of the most underestimated challenges of multi-probe geophysical surveys. Poor cable management leads to tangling, connection errors, tripping hazards, and wasted time during deployment and recovery. The following systematic approach transforms cable logistics from a frustration into a repeatable, efficient procedure.\n\n5.5.1 The Cable Challenge\nA standard 20-probe HIRT deployment involves 20 individual 3-5 meter cables, creating 60-100 meters of total cable length that must be routed, connected, and managed across uneven terrain. In wet or muddy conditions, cables become heavy and prone to picking up debris. Without a systematic approach, deployment can devolve into “cable spaghetti” where identifying connections becomes guesswork and extraction takes twice as long as installation.\nThe key principle is that systematic deployment prevents chaotic recovery. Investing 10 minutes in organized cable routing saves 30 minutes during extraction and dramatically reduces connection errors.\n\n\n5.5.2 Labeling System\nImplement a dual-coded labeling system that provides both visual (color) and alphanumeric (label) identification:\nColor Coding by Zone: Divide the probe array into 4-6 zones based on spatial grouping (e.g., North, South, East, West for square grids). Assign each zone a color using colored heat-shrink tubing or tape applied near both cable ends. This allows rapid visual identification from a distance and helps operators route bundles correctly.\nCommon zone color schemes: - North (blue), South (red), East (green), West (yellow) - Quadrants: Q1 (blue), Q2 (green), Q3 (yellow), Q4 (red) - Sequential zones: Z1 (blue), Z2 (green), Z3 (orange), Z4 (purple)\nNumbered Labels: Apply waterproof numbered labels (printed on heat-shrink tubing or laminated paper) at both ends of each cable. Use probe numbering that matches your grid layout (e.g., P01, P02, … P20). Verify that labels remain legible after exposure to mud, rain, and handling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField Tip: Label Durability\n\n\n\nPrint labels on waterproof laser-printable heat-shrink tubing (e.g., 3:1 ratio polyolefin) and apply with a heat gun. This creates permanent, abrasion-resistant labels that survive multiple field deployments. Alternatively, laminate paper labels and secure with clear heat-shrink as an outer layer.\n\n\n\n\n5.5.3 Deployment Sequence\nDeploy probes and cables in a systematic order rather than randomly inserting probes wherever convenient. Two effective patterns are:\nSpoke Pattern (Radial Deployment): Place the base hub at grid center or edge. Deploy probes moving outward from hub in radial spokes, laying cables as you go. This naturally organizes cables by direction and minimizes crossing.\n\nStart with probes nearest the hub\nWork outward along each cardinal direction (N, S, E, W)\nFill in intermediate positions between spokes\nEach cable follows a direct radial path to hub\n\nSequential Row/Column Deployment: For rectangular grids, deploy row-by-row or column-by-column. This works well when the hub is positioned along one edge.\n\nDeploy entire first row/column with cable bundle\nMove to next parallel row/column\nKeep cable bundles parallel and organized by row\nHub receives all cables from one side\n\nRegardless of pattern, the key is consistency. The same deployment sequence should be followed for extraction, simplifying identification and reducing the chance of leaving equipment behind.\n\n\n5.5.4 Cable Routing and Management\nSlack Management: Keep excess cable coiled at the probe end, not at the hub. This prevents a tangled mass at the central connection point and makes individual probe adjustments easier. Use 2-3 loose coils secured with a single velcro tie at each probe location.\nElevated Routing in Wet Conditions: In muddy or waterlogged sites, elevate cables above ground level using survey stakes or improvised supports. This prevents cables from sinking into mud, reduces debris pickup, and makes extraction far cleaner. Position stakes at 2-3 meter intervals and secure cables with velcro ties or clips.\nAvoid Crossing Cables: Design your routing pattern to minimize cable crossings. Where crossings are unavoidable, mark the intersection with a small flag or bright tie so operators know to untangle in reverse order during extraction.\nBundle Parallel Runs: When multiple cables follow the same path (common in spoke patterns), bundle them together with velcro ties every 2 meters. This prevents individual cables from wandering and reduces tangling. Do not use zip ties (difficult to remove for adjustment) or excessive tension (damages insulation).\n\n\n5.5.5 Connection Protocol\nFollow a systematic connection sequence to reduce errors and enable quick troubleshooting:\n\nDry-fit First: Before inserting probes, lay out all cables and verify labeling is correct. Match probe numbers to grid positions on paper.\nVerify Continuity: Before burial or full insertion, use a multimeter to quick-check resistance across cable ends (should read low ohms for good connections, open circuit for breaks).\nConnect in Order: Plug cables into the base hub in sequential order (P01, P02, P03…). This makes troubleshooting far easier than random connection order. Mark each port on the hub with corresponding probe numbers.\nQuick Resistance Check: After all connections are made, run a rapid resistance check across all probe pairs. This catches connector issues before beginning lengthy measurement sequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField Tip: Connection Error Prevention\n\n\n\nTake a photo of the fully connected base hub showing all cable labels plugged into their ports. If a cable becomes dislodged during the survey, this photo provides instant verification of correct reconnection without consulting field notes.\n\n\n\n\n5.5.6 Teardown and Recovery Procedure\nSystematic teardown in reverse order of deployment prevents cable tangling and ensures no equipment is left behind:\n\nDisconnect in Reverse Order: Unplug cables from hub in reverse sequence (P20, P19, P18…). Coil each cable immediately upon disconnection before moving to the next.\nOver-Under Coiling Method: Use the over-under coiling technique to prevent cable twisting. Alternate hand orientation with each loop: one loop with palm up, next loop with palm down. This creates a flat coil that unrolls without kinking.\nInspect During Coiling: As each cable is coiled, visually inspect for damage: nicks in insulation, bent connector pins, strained strain relief. Mark damaged cables for immediate repair before next deployment.\nExtract Probes Last: Remove cables first, then extract probes. This prevents accidentally pulling on connected cables during probe extraction, which can damage connectors or pull cables into mud.\nClean Before Storage: Wipe cables clean with a damp cloth while coiling. Removing mud and debris in the field is far easier than cleaning dried, caked-on soil in the lab.\n\n\n\n5.5.7 Storage and Transport\nProper storage prevents connector damage, cable tangling, and corrosion between field sessions:\nIndividual Cable Bags or Spools: Store each cable in a separate bag (ziplock or mesh) or on a small spool. Label the bag/spool with the cable number. This prevents tangling during transport and makes setup at the next site faster.\nDry Storage: Never store cables while wet or damp. Moisture trapped in connector housings promotes corrosion of pins and sockets. If cables get wet in the field, hang them to dry before coiling for storage.\nConnector Protection: Use dust caps on all connectors during storage. For DIY systems, 3D-printed caps or simple plastic bags secured with rubber bands prevent dirt intrusion and pin damage.\nTransport Organization: Use a dedicated cable bag, bin, or foam-lined case with compartments. Organize cables by zone (matching field deployment zones) so setup at the next site follows a familiar pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField Tip: Pre-Deployment Prep\n\n\n\nBefore leaving for a survey, lay out all cables in deployment order at the lab. This verifies you have the correct number, labels are legible, and connectors are clean. Taking 15 minutes for this check prevents discovering missing or damaged cables after probes are already in the ground.\n\n\n\n\n5.5.8 Quick Reference: Cable Management Checklist\nPre-Deployment: - [ ] All cables labeled with zone color and probe number - [ ] Labels legible and waterproof - [ ] Connectors inspected and clean - [ ] Correct count verified (match number of probes)\nDeployment: - [ ] Systematic deployment pattern chosen (spoke or sequential) - [ ] Slack coiled at probe end, not hub - [ ] Cables elevated in wet conditions - [ ] Parallel runs bundled with velcro ties - [ ] Connections verified before measurement\nRecovery: - [ ] Disconnect in reverse order - [ ] Over-under coiling method used - [ ] Visual inspection during coiling - [ ] Cables cleaned before storage - [ ] All cables accounted for (count matches deployment)\nStorage: - [ ] Individual bags or spools - [ ] Connectors protected with caps - [ ] Dry storage environment - [ ] Organized by zone for next deployment",

    "text": "5.6 Handling Field Obstructions\nReal-world field conditions rarely permit idealized grid placement. Tree roots, rocks, standing water, and buried utilities require adaptive deployment strategies. The key principle is that inversion algorithms use actual sensor positions—accurate documentation of where probes are matters more than achieving perfect grid geometry.\n\n5.6.1 When to Relocate vs Skip\n\n\n\nTable 5.5: Decision guidance for probe placement around obstructions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSituation\nRecommended Action\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nSmall root/rock at surface\nOffset probe 10-30 cm\nRecord actual position\n\n\nLarge obstruction (tree, boulder)\nSkip position entirely\nDocument in survey notes\n\n\nStanding water/soft ground\nRelocate to firm ground\nMay need wider offset\n\n\nBuried utility (confirmed)\nSkip with 1 m clearance\nSafety priority\n\n\nPartial insertion possible\nInsert to achievable depth\nRecord actual depth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.6.2 Partial Depth Insertion\nWhen a probe cannot reach full target depth due to subsurface obstructions (rock, dense clay, buried debris), partial insertion remains valuable:\n\nRecord the actual tip depth in survey geometry file (see Section 25.6)\nNote the obstruction type in field log (rock, clay, unknown)\nSensors above the obstruction remain valid for measurements\nExclude sensors below tip depth during inversion processing\nConsider progressive deployment: Start shallow (1 m), assess data, then extend depths in clear areas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartial Probes Are Still Useful\n\n\n\nA probe reaching only 2 m instead of 3 m still provides valid measurements for the upper sensors. The inversion mesh simply excludes electrode positions below the actual tip depth. This is far better than no probe at all.\n\n\n\n\n5.6.3 Position Measurement Procedures\nAccurate position recording enables proper inversion geometry. Three levels of precision are available depending on site requirements:\n\n5.6.3.1 Level 1: Tape Measure (Standard)\nFor most surveys, tape measure positioning relative to grid origin provides adequate precision:\n\nEstablish grid origin at a marked reference point (survey stake, corner post)\nMeasure X offset along the primary baseline direction\nMeasure Y offset perpendicular to baseline\nRecord to nearest 5 cm (sufficient for ~2 m probe spacing)\nNote direction convention (e.g., X = East, Y = North)\n\n\n\n5.6.3.2 Level 2: Total Station (High Precision)\nFor surveys requiring cm-level accuracy or complex topography:\n\nSet up total station with backsight to known point\nRecord each probe position as Easting, Northing, Elevation\nExport coordinates to survey geometry file\nInclude surface elevation for topographic correction\n\n\n\n5.6.3.3 Level 3: RTK-GPS (Absolute Coordinates)\nFor integration with GIS or multi-day surveys:\n\nEstablish RTK base station or connect to CORS network\nRecord WGS84 coordinates for each probe position\nInclude surface elevation (Z_surface)\nTransform to local grid if needed for inversion software\n\n\n\n\n5.6.4 Surface Elevation Recording\nWhen ground surface varies across the survey area (slopes, undulating terrain, crater edges), record surface elevation at each probe position:\n\n\n\nTable 5.6: Surface elevation recording requirements\n\n\n\n\n\nSurface Variation\nAction Required\nImpact on Inversion\n\n\n\n\n&lt; 20 cm across grid\nRecord as flat (Z=0)\nNegligible\n\n\n20-50 cm variation\nRelative elevations\nMinor mesh adjustment\n\n\n&gt; 50 cm variation\nFull topographic survey\nRequired for accuracy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor significant topography, record:\n\nz_surface_m: Ground surface elevation relative to lowest point (or absolute)\nz_tip_m: Probe tip depth below local surface (always negative)\nThe absolute tip position is then: z_surface_m + z_tip_m\n\n\n\n5.6.5 Photograph Documentation\nSupplement numerical records with photographs showing:\n\nOverview of deployed grid with numbered markers visible\nClose-up of any offset or skipped positions with obstruction\nReference scale in frame (survey stake with depth markings)\nGPS screenshot if using handheld unit",

This creates inefficiency: some areas may be over-sampled (features are shallow), while others are under-sampled (features are deeper than probes reach).\nProgressive deployment addresses this by:\n\nCollecting data before committing resources - Shallow survey reveals where deeper investigation is needed\nReducing mechanical risk - Fewer deep insertions means less chance of hitting obstructions\nEnabling adaptive sampling - Focus effort where anomalies indicate potential targets\nPreserving site integrity - Minimize ground disturbance in sensitive areas\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Data-Driven Depth Decisions\nAfter each phase, operators analyze data to answer:\n\nWhere are anomalies detected? –&gt; Extend depth in those areas\nWhere is background homogeneous? –&gt; Shallow data may be sufficient\nWhat depth do anomalies appear? –&gt; Plan next extension accordingly\nAre there indications of deeper features? –&gt; Continue extension\n\nThis transforms deployment from a single large commitment into an iterative refinement process.",

These materials lack magnetic permeability but still support eddy currents.\nSize vs Depth Relationship: Target detectability follows an approximate cube-law. A 10 cm artifact detectable at 1 m depth becomes nearly invisible at 2 m depth. For planning, assume minimum detectable size scales linearly with depth.\n\n\n8.6.2 Soil Disturbance Signatures (ERT-Lite)\nBackfilled Excavation: Bomb craters, trenches, and excavations refilled with soil show characteristic resistivity patterns. The backfill is typically less compacted, creating larger pore spaces that retain more moisture. This produces a low-resistivity anomaly.\nVoid/Cavity: Air-filled spaces produce high-resistivity anomalies. Air has effectively infinite resistivity, so even a small void creates a distinct signature.\nDecomposition Products: Organic decomposition releases conductive fluids that reduce resistivity. Burial sites often show a moderate low-resistivity zone with elongated geometry.\n\n\n8.6.3 Combined Signatures (Dual-Channel Fusion)\nBomb Crater with Metallic Debris: Clear bowl-shaped ERT disturbance with strong MIT responses concentrated near the crater base or scattered throughout the fill. Excavation priority is HIGH.\nBurial with Metal Artifacts: Modest rectangular ERT disturbance (grave shaft geometry) with small, discrete MIT anomalies aligned with the shaft. The presence of metal increases identification confidence.\nNatural Features Mimicking Targets: Tree root masses, clay lenses, and natural soil heterogeneity can produce ERT anomalies. The key discriminator is the MIT channel: natural features almost never produce metal responses.",

    "text": "9.4 Scenario 3: Swamp/Marsh Crash Sites\nWaterlogged and marshy terrain presents unique challenges for aircraft crash investigation. When bombers went down in soft, saturated ground, the combination of impact forces and unstable soil caused aircraft—and their crews—to sink progressively deeper over time. Unlike dry-ground crashes where wreckage remains near the surface, marsh impacts can result in debris fields extending 5-10+ meters below the current surface level.\nThe soft, organic-rich soil essentially “swallows” the wreckage: initial impact creates a crater that fills with water and sediment, while the weight of aircraft components causes continued subsidence over decades. This phenomenon is well-documented at WWII crash sites in Poland’s Silesian marshlands, the Netherlands’ polders, and similar low-lying areas across Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: Swamp/marsh crash site configuration showing probe deployment around the impact zone. Soft, saturated soil caused the aircraft to sink progressively deeper over decades. Extended 3.5m probes with low-frequency MIT (2-5 kHz) are essential for detecting debris at 5-8+ meter depths. Deployment platforms may be required due to soft ground conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.1 The Deep Burial Problem\nWhen aircraft crashed into saturated marshland, several factors combined to drive wreckage deep underground:\n\nImpact penetration: High-speed impact into soft ground creates an initial crater\nWaterlogging: The crater immediately fills with groundwater\nProgressive subsidence: Heavy metal components continue sinking through soft peat and clay\nSediment accumulation: Organic material and sediment fill the depression from above\nDecades of compression: 80+ years of soil compaction further buries the debris\n\nThe result: aircraft that hit dry ground remain within 1-2 meters of the surface, while marsh impacts can place wreckage 5-10+ meters deep.\n\n\n9.4.2 Configuration Parameters\n\nRod Length: Maximum available (3.0-3.5 m) - depth is the primary challenge\nProbe Spacing: 2-3 m around the perimeter of the suspected impact zone\nSection Size: 8-12 m diameter coverage for typical bomber crash footprint\nProbe Count: 8-12 probes in perimeter configuration\nDeployment: Use platforms/boards on soft ground; may require temporary walkways\n\n\n\n9.4.3 Measurement Strategy\n\nLow MIT Frequencies: 2-5 kHz essential for maximum depth penetration\nExtended Integration: 15-30 second measurements for weak deep signals\nMulti-Frequency Sweep: Start at 2 kHz, sweep to 10 kHz to characterize depth\nERT for Context: Maps saturated zones and disturbed fill boundaries\nRepeat Measurements: Multiple passes to confirm weak signals at detection limits\n\n\n\n9.4.4 Deployment Considerations\nSoft ground conditions require careful planning for both safety and data quality:\n\nGround Assessment: Test soil firmness before committing to probe positions\nDeployment Platforms: Plywood boards or temporary walkways distribute weight\nProbe Insertion: May require pilot holes; avoid forcing probes through root mats\nWater Table Effects: High conductivity of saturated soil limits ERT depth; rely primarily on MIT\nSeasonal Timing: Drier seasons may improve access but water table remains high\nExtended Survey Time: Budget 2-3x longer than dry-ground surveys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetection Limits\n\n\n\nTargets at 6+ meters in conductive saturated soil approach HIRT’s detection limits.

A 16mm rod requires only an 18-20mm hole, with cross-sectional area of approximately 2.5-3.1 cm2 (\\(\\pi \\times 1.0^2\\) cm). At 3m depth, this creates only 0.75-0.93 liters of displacement per hole. In contrast, traditional 25mm rods requiring 50mm holes produce cross-sectional area of approximately 19.6 cm2 (\\(\\pi \\times 2.5^2\\) cm), displacing approximately 5.9 liters per hole at 3m depth. This represents a 6-7x reduction in soil disturbance volume with the HIRT micro-probe design.",

The technique multiplies the received signal by reference sine and cosine waveforms at the excitation frequency, then low-pass filters to extract the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components.\nThe lock-in algorithm provides exceptional noise rejection (&gt; 40 dB improvement) by responding only to signals at the exact reference frequency.

    "section": "14.4 Wiring Architecture",
    "text": "14.4 Wiring Architecture\nThe HIRT system uses a hierarchical wiring architecture designed to manage the complexity of connecting 20-50 passive probes. Rather than routing all probe cables directly to the main hub (which would require 600+ conductors), the system uses a Zone Wiring Strategy that aggregates signals through intermediate junction boxes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.1: Zone wiring architecture showing probe groupings, zone boxes, and trunk cable routing to the central hub. Each zone aggregates 4 probes through a passive junction box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.4.1 System Topology\nThe zone architecture divides the probe array into manageable groups of 4 probes each. Each group connects to a Zone Box (small passive hub) via individual probe cables. The Zone Box then connects to the Main Hub via a single high-density Trunk Cable. This reduces the number of cables entering the main enclosure from 20+ to just 5-6 trunk cables.\n\nZone Box: Small IP65 enclosure (100x100mm) with 4 cable glands for probes and 1 DB25 connector for trunk output\nTrunk Cable: High-quality shielded 25-conductor cable, 10-20 meters, carrying signals for 4 probes\nAdvantages: Modular expansion, clean installation, field-ready deployment\n\n\n\n14.4.2 Wiring Harness Layout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.2: Wiring harness architecture from probe sensors through junction box and zone box to the main hub. The multi-conductor shielded cable (2-4mm diameter) carries all sensor signals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.4.3 Connector Pinout Reference\nThe system uses 12-pin Phoenix Contact connectors (part number 1757248) or equivalent for probe-side connections. The pinout is standardized across all probes to ensure interchangeability and simplify field maintenance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.3: 12-pin Phoenix connector pinout showing signal assignments and recommended wire colors. Pins 1-4 carry MIT coil differential pairs, pins 6-8 carry ERT electrode signals.",

Use steady, even strokes with the hacksaw and rotate the tube to keep the cut square. After cutting, deburr the ends by removing fiberglass fibers with a file and sanding smooth with 400-grit sandpaper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRod Assembly Convention\n\n\n\n\nRods have Male threads at bottom, Female at top\nApply epoxy to flange of insert before installation\nEnsure shoulder sits flush against tube cut\nAllow 24 hours cure time before stressing threads\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.3 Field Assembly Sequence\nAssembly proceeds from the bottom (tip) and works upward. Each joint uses thread sealant and an O-ring for waterproofing. The cable is threaded through each segment before connecting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.4: Six-step assembly sequence: (1) Prepare probe tip, (2) Thread cable through first segment, (3) Add sensor module, (4) Seat O-ring on thread shoulder, (5) Stack additional segments, (6) Install top cap with cable strain relief.",

Calibration ensures accurate and consistent measurements across all probes in the array. The dual-channel nature of HIRT (MIT and ERT) requires calibration of both subsystems, along with system-level verification to ensure the complete measurement chain performs within specification.\nProper calibration is essential for scientific data quality. Without it, probe-to-probe variations can introduce systematic errors that compromise tomographic reconstruction.

    "section": "18.7 Why Crosshole Geometry Beats Surface Methods",
    "text": "18.7 Why Crosshole Geometry Beats Surface Methods\nHIRT’s borehole/crosshole tomography provides fundamental physics advantages over surface geophysical methods for targets deeper than approximately 1.5 m. These advantages stem from the geometry of measurement ray paths and the resulting illumination angles.\n\n18.7.1 Surface vs. Crosshole: A Medical Analogy\nThe distinction between surface and crosshole geophysics parallels the difference between medical X-ray imaging and CT scanning. A single X-ray provides a 2D projection of 3D anatomy—all structures along the ray path collapse into a single shadow. Computed tomography (CT) surrounds the patient with detectors, acquiring projections from hundreds of angles to reconstruct true 3D anatomy.\nSurface geophysical methods operate like X-rays: all sensors are above the target, looking downward. They measure the integrated response along a single dominant direction. A target at 2 m depth produces nearly the same surface signature whether it sits at 1.8 m or 2.2 m depth—vertical resolution is inherently poor because all ray paths travel steeply through the target zone.\nCrosshole tomography operates like CT scanning: probes surround the target volume, acquiring measurements from many angles. A target at 2 m depth is illuminated horizontally, diagonally, and from below by ray paths connecting different probe pairs. This angular diversity enables true 3D reconstruction with isotropic resolution—the ability to distinguish targets separated by similar distances horizontally or vertically.\nThis is not merely an improvement in data processing; it is a fundamental physics advantage driven by measurement geometry. You cannot compute tomography from surface data because the ray paths lack angular diversity. Crosshole geometry provides that diversity by design.\n\n\n18.7.2 Ray Path Geometry\nSurface methods must send energy down to a target and receive the return signal—doubling the path length and exponentially increasing attenuation. Sensitivity decreases as 1/r^2 to 1/r^4 with depth. More critically, nearly all energy travels vertically through the target, providing excellent lateral resolution but poor vertical discrimination.\nCrosshole methods send signals horizontally through the target volume. Energy travels directly between probes at depth, with sensitivity concentrated precisely where targets are located. This geometry provides 2-5x better resolution than surface methods at depths exceeding 2 m (theoretical advantage based on ray coverage geometry; field validation pending), with approximately isotropic resolution in all three dimensions.\n\n\n18.7.3 Illumination Angles and Angular Diversity\nThe fundamental advantage of crosshole geometry lies in angular diversity—the range of angles from which energy interrogates the target. Surface methods illuminate targets from a narrow cone of angles (typically 60-80 degrees from vertical), while crosshole methods provide illumination from nearly all directions in the horizontal plane and many angles in the vertical plane.\nConsider a 0.5 m diameter spherical target at 2.5 m depth in a 3-probe HIRT array with 2 m spacing. The target experiences:\n\n12 unique ray paths between probe pairs (3 probes * 4 measurement depths * 2 channels = 24 measurement geometries)\nAngular coverage spanning 180 degrees in horizontal plane\nVertical angles from -45 to +45 degrees relative to target center\n\nThis angular diversity directly translates to reconstruction quality. Tomographic inversion requires measurements that sample the target from multiple perspectives. A general rule: resolution improves linearly with the number of independent viewing angles up to approximately 20-30 angles, after which diminishing returns occur.\n\nFigure Concept: Illumination angle comparison diagram\nA side-by-side comparison showing ray path angles for surface vs. crosshole geometry:\nLeft panel (Surface ERT/MIT): - Show 5-7 surface sensors arranged in a line above ground - Draw ray paths from each sensor down to a target at 2.5 m depth - All rays converge downward in a narrow cone (60-80 deg from vertical) - Color-code rays by angle: steep (red), moderate (orange), shallow (yellow) - Annotate: “All rays from above - poor vertical resolution”\nRight panel (HIRT Crosshole): - Show 3 probes at 2 m spacing inserted to 3 m depth - Draw ray paths connecting probes at multiple depths through a target at 2.5 m - Include horizontal rays (green), ascending rays (blue), descending rays (purple) - Show angular coverage: 180 deg horizontal, +/- 45 deg vertical - Annotate: “Rays from all directions - isotropic 3D resolution”\nBottom comparison: - Small polar plot for each showing angular coverage - Surface: narrow wedge (60-80 deg) - Crosshole: nearly full circle coverage\nScale: use consistent 1 m grid spacing. Target shown as 0.5 m sphere at 2.5 m depth.\nType: diagram\n\nSurface methods concentrate their ray paths in the vertical direction. A Wenner array with 1 m electrode spacing samples the subsurface primarily along near-vertical current paths. The resulting sensitivity pattern is pancake-shaped: excellent lateral resolution but poor depth discrimination. Targets at 2.0 m vs. 2.5 m depth may show &lt;10% difference in measured apparent resistivity.\nCrosshole methods distribute ray paths across many angles. The sensitivity pattern is approximately spherical around each probe, with maximum sensitivity along the direct probe-to-probe lines. Targets at 2.0 m vs. 2.5 m depth show &gt;50% difference in affected ray paths, enabling confident depth determination.\n\n\n18.7.4 Resolution Comparison: Surface vs. Crosshole\nThe following table quantifies the resolution advantage of crosshole geometry at depth. Resolution is defined as the minimum separation at which two point targets can be distinguished with &gt;80% confidence in inverted models.\n\n\n\nTable 18.4: Resolution comparison across geophysical methods at typical HIRT investigation depths. Note that HIRT provides approximately isotropic resolution (similar in all directions), while surface methods show 3-6x worse vertical than lateral resolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nLateral Resolution\nVertical Resolution\nResolution at 3 m Depth\nDepth Limit\n\n\n\n\nSurface Magnetometry\n1-2 m\nPoor (&gt;3 m)\n~2 m lateral\n3-4 m (ferrous only)\n\n\nGPR (100 MHz)\n0.3-0.5 m (shallow)\n0.05-0.1 m (shallow)\n&gt;1 m (clay absorbs signal)\n0.5-2 m in clay\n\n\nSurface ERT (Wenner)\n~1x spacing\n~0.5x spacing\n2-3 m lateral\n4-6 m\n\n\nEM31/CMD\n1-2 m\nPoor (&gt;3 m)\n~2 m lateral\n3-5 m (conductive)\n\n\nHIRT Crosshole MIT\n0.5-1x spacing\n0.3-0.5x spacing\n0.75-1.5 m (isotropic)\n3-4 m\n\n\nHIRT Crosshole ERT\n0.5-1x spacing\n0.3-0.5x spacing\n0.75-1.5 m (isotropic)\n3-5 m\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key distinction is isotropic vs. anisotropic resolution. Surface methods provide good lateral resolution but poor vertical resolution because all ray paths are steeply inclined. Crosshole methods provide similar resolution in all three dimensions because ray paths sample all orientations.\n\n\n18.7.5 Why This Matters for HIRT Applications\nThe resolution and angular diversity advantages of crosshole geometry directly address the core challenges in HIRT target scenarios.\n\n18.7.5.1 Bomb Crater Investigations\nUnexploded bombs buried at 2-4 m depth in craters backfilled with mixed soil, rubble, and organic debris present multiple challenges:\n\nVertical stratification: Craters fill in layers over decades. Surface methods cannot distinguish a target at 2.5 m depth in fill layer 3 from a target at 3.5 m depth in fill layer 5. HIRT’s vertical resolution (0.5-1 m) enables layer-by-layer reconstruction.\nMultiple targets: Bomb fragments, shrapnel, vehicle debris, and potentially human remains may cluster within a 2 m radius. Surface magnetometry sees this as a single diffuse anomaly. HIRT resolves individual objects separated by &gt;0.75 m.\nNon-ferrous detection: Aluminum aircraft debris lacks magnetic signature but strongly affects MIT measurements. ERT detects the void or disturbed soil around buried objects.\n\n\n\n18.7.5.2 Woodland Burial Detection\nClandestine burials in wooded areas at 1-3 m depth:\n\nSurface clutter: Tree roots, stones, animal burrows, and soil heterogeneity create overwhelming noise in surface measurements. HIRT probes are inserted below the root zone; measurements occur in undisturbed soil below 0.5 m.\nDepth determination: Legal and operational decisions depend on accurate depth. “Approximately 2 m” from surface ERT is insufficient. HIRT provides depth estimates with +/- 0.3 m confidence.\nDisturbance geometry: The 3D shape of disturbed soil (rectangular pit vs. natural void) aids classification. This requires 3D imaging, which crosshole geometry provides but surface methods cannot.\n\n\n\n18.7.5.3 Swamp/Marsh Crash Sites\nAircraft wreckage in saturated, highly conductive soils at 2-5 m depth:\n\nGPR failure: High conductivity limits GPR penetration to &lt;0.5 m. HIRT MIT operates at frequencies (2-10 kHz) where skin depth exceeds 10 m even in saturated soil.\nDepth penetration: ERT performance improves with soil conductivity (better current injection). Surface ERT depth limit is ~4 m; HIRT extends this to 5-6 m in favorable conditions.\nDebris field mapping: Crash debris scatters over 10-30 m laterally and 3-5 m vertically. True 3D reconstruction is essential for recovery planning. Surface methods provide 2D projections that cannot distinguish a compact debris field at 3 m from a dispersed field spanning 2-4 m depth.\n\n\n\n\n18.7.6 Additional Crosshole Advantages\nBeyond resolution and angular diversity, crosshole methods offer several practical advantages:\n\nNo surface interference: Measurements occur below near-surface heterogeneity, fill, roots, and cultural noise (fences, vehicles)\nTrue 3D sampling: Multiple ray paths at different angles enable tomographic reconstruction—not pseudo-depth estimation from diffraction patterns\nSuperior depth discrimination: Targets at 3 m vs. 4 m depth are clearly distinguishable; surface methods show nearly identical responses\nScalable depth: Surface method depth is fixed by the instrument design. HIRT investigation depth scales with probe insertion depth (up to physical limits of ~5 m).",

    "text": "19.9 Site Suitability and Method Selection\nDeploying HIRT effectively requires understanding when the method excels and when alternative techniques may be more appropriate. While HIRT offers unique capabilities for simultaneous metal detection and soil disturbance imaging at depth, certain site conditions favor other geophysical approaches. We developed the following decision framework based on field trials across diverse investigation scenarios.\n\n19.9.1 Comparative Method Assessment\nHIRT occupies a distinct niche in the geophysical toolkit: it provides true 3D tomographic imaging through crosshole geometry while maintaining sensitivity to both conductive targets (MIT-3D) and resistivity anomalies (ERT-Lite). This dual-mode capability becomes critical when target characteristics are uncertain or when soil disturbance patterns provide complementary evidence to metal signatures.\n\n\n\nTable 19.2: Geophysical method comparison for subsurface investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nDepth Range\nResolution\nMetal Sens.\nSoil Sens.\nDeploy Time\nRelative Cost\n\n\n\n\nHIRT\n1-3 m\nHigh (0.3-0.5 m)\nExcellent (Al+Fe)\nExcellent\n2-4 hrs\nHigh\n\n\nGPR\n0-2 m\nModerate (0.2-0.4 m)\nGood (if dry)\nPoor\n1-2 hrs\nMedium\n\n\nMagnetometry\n0-3 m\nLow (0.5-1.0 m)\nFe only\nNone\n0.5-1 hr\nLow\n\n\nSurface ERT\n0-5 m\nPoor (1-2 m)\nNone\nGood\n1-2 hrs\nMedium\n\n\nEMI/Metal Detector\n0-1.5 m\nPoor (0.3-0.8 m)\nGood\nNone\n0.5-1 hr\nLow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19.9.2 When to Deploy HIRT\nHIRT achieves optimal performance under conditions that favor both probe insertion and electromagnetic propagation. We recommend HIRT deployment when investigation requirements align with the following ideal conditions:\nSoil Conditions: Soft to medium soils that permit probe insertion to target depth without excessive force. Sandy loams, silty clays, and woodland humus layers are ideal substrates. Probes penetrate these materials with minimal disturbance, establishing reliable electrode contact for ERT measurements while maintaining stable coil positioning for MIT-3D.\nTarget Depth and Size: Targets located in the 1-3 m depth range represent HIRT’s performance sweet spot. Shallower targets often resolve more efficiently with surface methods (GPR, magnetometry), while deeper targets exceed the effective imaging volume given practical probe spacing constraints. Target dimensions should exceed approximately 0.3-0.5 m in at least one dimension to generate detectable anomalies.\nInvestigation Requirements: Cases requiring simultaneous characterization of metallic objects and associated soil disturbance strongly favor HIRT over single-mode techniques. Archaeological features involving both ferrous artifacts and disturbed fill, bomb craters containing fragmented ordnance within backfilled soil, and aircraft crash sites with aluminum debris in displaced sediment all benefit from dual-channel imaging.\nSite Geometry: The crosshole measurement approach requires establishing a two-dimensional array surrounding or bracketing the target volume. Linear sites (pipeline corridors, trench lines) permit probe placement, but the resulting ray path distribution yields lower resolution than full perimeter deployments. Ideal sites allow 3-5 m diameter circular or square arrays with 12-25 probe positions.\nOperational Context: HIRT deployment makes practical sense when investigation time exceeds 2-4 hours and when the value of high-resolution 3D data justifies the setup effort. Single-point target confirmation often resolves faster with handheld metal detectors or penetrometers, but systematic surveys of unknown target distributions benefit from HIRT’s comprehensive imaging capability.\n\n\n19.9.3 When to Avoid HIRT\nCertain site conditions fundamentally limit HIRT performance or present contraindications that favor alternative methods. Recognizing these scenarios prevents wasted deployment effort and ensures appropriate technique selection.\nGround Conditions Preventing Insertion: Rocky substrates, heavily consolidated clays, frozen ground, and concrete/asphalt surfaces physically prevent probe insertion to target depth. We have attempted pilot hole methods in glacial till and weathered bedrock with limited success - the insertion effort becomes prohibitive and often damages probe assemblies. Sites with subsurface cobble layers or buried construction debris similarly resist probe penetration.\nElectromagnetic Interference: Dense urban environments with overhead power lines, buried utilities, and metal infrastructure generate continuous electromagnetic noise across HIRT’s 2-50 kHz operating range. MIT-3D measurements become unreliable when ambient noise exceeds signal levels by more than 20 dB. ERT measurements remain functional in these conditions, but the loss of MIT capability removes much of HIRT’s advantage over conventional resistivity surveys.\nExtreme Soil Conductivity: Highly saline soils, brackish groundwater, and seawater-saturated sediments create conductive pathways that short-circuit ERT current injection at typical 0.5-2 mA levels. While MIT-3D may still function, the loss of resistivity imaging again reduces HIRT to single-mode operation. Marine and coastal sites often fall into this category.\nShallow Target Distribution: Targets located in the top 0.5 m of soil resolve more efficiently with surface methods. GPR provides rapid areal coverage without ground penetration, while handheld metal detectors locate ferrous and non-ferrous objects interactively. The HIRT deployment overhead (probe insertion, cable connection, measurement sequence) cannot compete with surface techniques for near-surface work.\nDeep Targets Beyond Resolution Limit: Targets deeper than 5 m fall outside HIRT’s practical imaging range given realistic probe spacing (1.5-2.0 m) and signal strength limitations. While MIT-3D can detect large ferrous masses to greater depths in favorable conditions, the ERT component loses resolution rapidly beyond 3-4 m. Deep target investigations require borehole logging tools or surface geophysics with longer electrode arrays.\nConstrained Site Access: Linear sites, narrow corridors, and inaccessible terrain that prevent establishing crosshole geometry eliminate HIRT’s primary advantage. Single borehole or surface-to-borehole configurations may still provide useful data, but they sacrifice the tomographic imaging capability that justifies the method’s complexity. In these cases, simpler borehole geophysical tools often prove more effective.\nExplosive Ordnance Risk: Sites with confirmed or suspected unexploded ordnance require specialized protocols that may preclude invasive probe deployment. While HIRT offers perimeter-only array configurations for standoff detection (Section 19.8), the insertion process itself presents unacceptable risk in extreme UXO scenarios. Professional explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) teams may prohibit any ground penetration until surface clearance completes.\n\n\n19.9.4 Pre-Deployment Site Assessment\nBefore committing to HIRT deployment, we recommend a systematic site assessment to verify suitability and identify potential challenges. This rapid evaluation typically requires 30-60 minutes and substantially improves deployment success rates.\nPhysical Reconnaissance: Walk the site perimeter and identify proposed probe locations. Probe the soil at 3-5 representative positions using a 10mm steel rod driven by hand or with light hammer blows. The rod should penetrate to target depth (typically 2-3 m) without excessive resistance. Encountering refusal depth, buried obstructions, or requiring heavy sledgehammer impacts indicates unsuitable conditions.\nSoil Characterization: Extract soil samples at proposed insertion depths using the same pilot rod or a hand auger. Examine texture, moisture content, and cohesion. Ideal soils form a cohesive core on the auger and show moderate moisture. Dry sand or saturated clay present challenges for electrode contact. Gravel-rich soils or highly organic material (peat, woody debris) may prevent effective probe insertion.\nElectromagnetic Noise Survey: Deploy a portable metal detector or EMI sensor at the proposed measurement frequency (typically 5-20 kHz for MIT-3D). Record background readings with instrument stationary for 1-2 minutes. Noise spikes exceeding 50% of expected target signals indicate challenging conditions. Identify and map noise sources (power lines, buried cables, metal fencing) and adjust array layout to maximize distance from interference.\nAccess and Logistics: Verify vehicle access to within 50 m of the array center for equipment transport. Identify flat working area for central electronics hub placement with protection from weather. Confirm availability of electrical power for battery charging (if multi-day deployment) and data logging equipment. Map any access restrictions (locked gates, seasonal flooding, vegetation) that could delay deployment.\nRegulatory and Safety Review: Confirm land access permissions and any required permits for invasive investigation.

    "text": "30.3 Forensic Data Integrity and Chain of Custody\nHIRT surveys conducted in support of criminal investigations, human rights documentation, or conflict archaeology must adhere to forensic standards that ensure data integrity and admissibility in legal proceedings.\n\n30.3.1 Why Chain of Custody Matters\nHIRT-derived evidence may support criminal prosecutions, civil litigation, or international tribunals investigating war crimes. Data integrity depends on documented procedures satisfying three core requirements:\nAuthenticity: Proof that data originated from the stated location and time, collected by identified personnel using verified equipment.\nContinuity: An unbroken record of who handled the data, when transfers occurred, and what actions were performed.\nIntegrity: Verification that data remains unchanged from collection. Cryptographic hashes (MD5, SHA-256) provide mathematical proof.\n\n\n30.3.2 Data Collection Protocol\nEvery forensic HIRT survey must capture comprehensive metadata:\nSurvey Identification: Use format [DATE]-[SITE]-[OPERATOR], e.g., 20260130-KAMPALA-SMITH\nTemporal Documentation: Embed UTC timestamps in all data files. Record local time zone offset.\nOperator Credentials: Record full name, affiliation, and certifications of all personnel.\nEquipment Traceability: Log serial numbers of all probes, data loggers, GPS units, and calibration standards.\nInstrument Settings: Record all acquisition parameters including frequencies, current levels, and filter settings.\n\n\n30.3.3 Field Documentation\nSite Photography: Capture wide-angle photographs before probe insertion. Document each probe location. Include scale reference and compass orientation.\nGeolocation Data: Record GPS coordinates (WGS84) using survey-grade receiver with sub-meter accuracy. Document DOP values.\nEnvironmental Conditions: Log weather, soil moisture, and vegetation type.\nWitness Signatures: In some jurisdictions, forensic surveys require independent witness verification.\nField Sketches: Draw scaled diagrams showing probe locations relative to permanent landmarks.\n\n\n30.3.4 Data Handling Procedures\nOriginal File Preservation: Copy raw data to write-protected media immediately. Never analyze original files.\nCryptographic Hash Verification: Compute MD5 and SHA-256 hashes immediately after collection. Verify before any analysis.\nSecure Storage: Use access-controlled, encrypted storage with audit logging. Maintain three independent copies.\nAccess Logging: Record every access to data files including date, time, user, and actions performed.\n\n\n30.3.5 Transfer Protocols\nPhysical Media Transfer: Use chain of custody form. Package in tamper-evident bags with serialized seals.\nDigital Transfer: Use encrypted protocols (SFTP, secure cloud). Log transfer events with hash verification.\nThird-Party Analysis: Establish written agreements specifying handling requirements and destruction procedures.\nInternational Transfer: Cross-border transfers may trigger export controls and data privacy regulations. Consult legal counsel.\n\n\n30.3.6 Reporting Requirements\nMethodology Section: Describe HIRT measurement principle, configuration, and processing workflow in sufficient detail for independent evaluation.\nSoftware Documentation: Identify all software with version numbers and configuration settings.\nLimitations and Uncertainty: State measurement uncertainties, depth resolution limits, and factors affecting interpretation. Provide confidence levels.\nOperator Qualifications: Include statement of education, training, and experience.\nPeer Review: Consider independent review for high-stakes proceedings.\n\n\n30.3.7 Chain of Custody Form Template\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIRT Data Chain of Custody Form\n\n\n\nCase Identifier: ___________________________ Survey ID: ___________________________ Date of Collection: ___________________________\n\nEvidence Description:\n\nData file names: ___________________________\nNumber of files: ___________________________\nStorage media: ___________________________\nTotal data volume: ___________________________\n\nHash Values (at time of collection):\n\nMD5: ___________________________\nSHA-256: ___________________________\n\n\nTransfer Log:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate/Time\nReleased By (Signature)\nReceived By (Signature)\nPurpose\nLocation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Handling Instructions: _________________________________________________________\nDisposition (Final): Returned to originator [ ] Permanently archived [ ] Destroyed [ ]\nDate: ___________ Authorized By: ___________________________",
