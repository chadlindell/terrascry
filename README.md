# HIRT - Hybrid Inductive-Resistive Tomography

A modular, in-ground probe array integrating magneto-inductive (low-frequency EM) and electrical resistivity measurements for high-resolution 3-D subsurface imaging in archaeological and forensic contexts.

## Project Description

**Hybrid Inductive-Resistive Tomography (HIRT)** is a DIY probe-array subsurface imaging system developed for archaeological recovery of WWII aircraft crash sites. The system integrates magneto-inductive and electrical resistivity measurements using modular dual-role probes to generate volumetric conductivity and resistivity models to depths of 3–6 m.

## Key Features

- **Dual-Method Imaging:** MIT (magneto-inductive) + ERT (electrical resistivity)
- **Modular Design:** Identical dual-role probes simplify logistics
- **Low Cost:** $1,800–3,900 for complete starter kit
- **Field-Ready:** Designed for archaeological/forensic field teams
- **DIY-Friendly:** Detailed documentation for construction

## System Overview

- **Probes:** 20–24 identical dual-role probes
- **Depth:** 2–6 m investigation depth (depending on configuration)
- **Resolution:** 0.5–1.5 m lateral resolution
- **Applications:** Aircraft wreckage, disturbed fill, voids, potential burials

## Getting Started

1. **Read the Documentation:** Start with [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)
2. **Review the White Paper:** [docs/whitepaper/main.md](docs/whitepaper/main.md)
3. **Check BOM:** [hardware/bom/](hardware/bom/) for components
4. **Order Components:** Use [order sheets](hardware/bom/order-sheets/)
5. **Build System:** Follow [build/](build/) instructions

## Important Warnings

⚠️ **UXO Risk:** WWII sites can contain live ordnance. Do not deploy until cleared by qualified EOD/UXO professionals.

⚠️ **Ethics & Legal:** Obtain all permits and permissions. Follow jurisdictional requirements for archaeological/forensic work.

⚠️ **Human Remains:** Treat as forensic/archaeological context with proper protocols.

## Status

- **Documentation:** v0.9 (Complete)
- **Hardware Design:** In progress (schematics/drawings pending)
- **Software:** Future development (see [Section 19](docs/whitepaper/sections/19-next-steps.md))

## Cost Estimate

- **Complete Starter Kit:** $1,800–3,900
  - 20 probes: $1,400–3,000
  - Base hub: $200–500
  - Tools and supplies: $200–400

## Use Cases

- Filled bomb craters (~10–15 m diameter, ~3 m deep)
- Woods burials (0.6–1.5 m depth)
- Swamp/perched water impacts (>5 m targets)
