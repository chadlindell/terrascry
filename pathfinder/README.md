# Pathfinder

**Handheld multi-sensor fluxgate gradiometer for rapid geophysical reconnaissance**

Pathfinder is an open-source, harness-supported magnetic gradiometer array designed for rapid pre-screening of survey areas before detailed investigation. Named for the WWII pathfinder aircraft that marked targets for following bomber formations, this tool identifies anomalies so that detailed systems like [HIRT](https://github.com/hirt-project/hirt) can be deployed efficiently.

## Purpose

Walking a site with Pathfinder in 5-10 minutes can identify magnetic anomalies that would take hours to find with detailed tomographic methods. This two-stage workflow (rapid screening → targeted investigation) dramatically reduces total survey time.

## Key Features

- **Harness-supported**: Weight carried on shoulders, hands only guide
- **Multi-channel**: 2-4 gradiometer pairs for wide swath coverage
- **Lightweight**: Target <1.5 kg total system weight
- **GPS-tagged**: Automatic position logging for anomaly mapping
- **Open hardware**: Full schematics, BOM, and firmware available
- **DIY-friendly**: ~$600-900 total build cost

## Applications

- Archaeological site reconnaissance
- UXO survey pre-screening
- Forensic search area prioritization
- Environmental assessment
- Geological mapping

## Status

**Early development** - Design phase, capturing requirements and prototyping.

## Historical Note

The name "Pathfinder" honors the 15th Air Force crews who flew missions over Blechhammer (now Blachownia, Poland) during WWII. Pathfinder aircraft marked targets for the bomber formations that followed. This tool serves a similar purpose: marking targets for the detailed investigation systems that follow.
