# HIRT Whitepaper Image Generation Plan

**Status:** Planned
**Engine:** Gemini 2.5 Flash (NanoBanana)

## 1. Document Cover Art
**Target:** `docs/hirt-whitepaper/assets/images/cover_art.png`
**Concept:** A high-tech visualization of the "Tomography" concept.
**Prompt:**
> "Technical 3D cross-section of earth soil, 20 metallic probes inserted vertically in a grid pattern. Glowing blue electromagnetic field lines connect the probes, revealing a buried red iron object (unexploded bomb) deep underground. Architectural visualization style, clean, scientific, high resolution, 8k."
**Style:** 3D Render / Architectural

## 2. Zone Hub Hero Shot (Field Ops)
**Target:** `docs/hirt-whitepaper/sections/10-field-operations_files/zone_hub_concept.png`
**Concept:** Showcasing the ruggedness of the new hardware design (Weipu connectors).
**Prompt:**
> "Close up product photography of a rugged orange weatherproof industrial electronics box (IP68) sitting on wet grass in a field. Four heavy-duty black cables with circular metal connectors (Weipu style) are plugged into the side panel. Muddy field background, overcast lighting, shallow depth of field, photorealistic."
**Style:** Photorealistic

## 3. Probe Detail (Mechanical)
**Target:** `docs/hirt-whitepaper/sections/05-mechanical-design_files/probe_tip_render.png`
**Concept:** Visualizing the new "Ogive" tip geometry discussed in research.
**Prompt:**
> "Macro engineering render of a white Delrin probe tip for a soil sensor. The tip has a smooth ogive (bullet-like) shape. It is screwed onto a black fiberglass rod. Clean white studio background, soft lighting, technical product design style."
**Style:** Product Design / CAD Render

## 4. Field Operator Context
**Target:** `docs/hirt-whitepaper/sections/01-executive-summary_files/field_deployment.png`
**Concept:** Showing the scale of a 10x10m grid.
**Prompt:**
> "Wide shot of an archaeological survey in a forest clearing. Small orange flags mark a 10x10 meter grid on the ground. A field scientist in high-vis vest is inserting a slim probe into the ground. A rugged tablet on a tripod displays a heat map. Realistic, cinematic lighting."
**Style:** Cinematic / Photorealistic
