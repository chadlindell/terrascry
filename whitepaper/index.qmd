# Preface {.unnumbered}

This whitepaper provides comprehensive documentation for the HIRT (Hybrid Inductive-Resistivity Tomography) system, a dual-channel subsurface imaging platform designed for archaeological and forensic investigations.

## About This Document

HIRT was developed to address a critical gap in accessible subsurface imaging technology. While commercial crosshole tomography systems exist, their cost ($50,000-200,000+) places them beyond the reach of most research institutions, humanitarian organizations, and archaeological teams. HIRT achieves comparable capabilities at a fraction of the cost ($1,800-3,900), enabling professional-grade 3D subsurface imaging for applications including:

- **WWII crash site investigations** - Locating aircraft remains and crew
- **UXO (unexploded ordnance) detection** - Pre-clearance assessment for bomb disposal
- **Forensic archaeology** - Non-destructive grave detection and characterization
- **Archaeological prospection** - Mapping subsurface features before excavation

## Document Organization

This whitepaper is organized into four main parts:

**Part I: Foundations** covers the theoretical basis for HIRT, including the physics of electromagnetic induction and electrical resistivity, system architecture, and the rationale for design decisions.

**Part II: Building** provides complete instructions for constructing a HIRT system, from bill of materials through assembly, testing, and calibration.

**Part III: Field Operations** details deployment procedures, data recording protocols, interpretation guidelines, and troubleshooting.

**Part IV: Reference** includes glossary, quick reference cards, field checklists, application scenarios, and development roadmap.
