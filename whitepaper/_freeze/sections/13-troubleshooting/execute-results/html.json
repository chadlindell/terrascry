Systematic troubleshooting ensures minimal downtime and maximum data quality during surveys.\n\n## Diagnostic Approach {#sec-diagnostic-approach}\n\n### System Check Procedure {#sec-system-check}\n\nWhen issues arise, follow this systematic check procedure:\n\n1. **Hub Power:** Verify the Central Hub power LED is green.\n2. **Zone Continuity:** Check continuity between Hub Trunk port and Probe tip (using DMM).\n3. **Trunk Seating:** Ensure all DB25/Trunk connectors are fully seated and screwed in.\n4. **MIT Baseline:** Verify TX to RX coupling on two probes in air before insertion.\n\n### Quick Reference Table {#sec-ts-quick-reference}\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----|\n| RX saturation on nearby probes | TX too strong | Lower TX level; rotate coils to orthogonal |\n| Noisy MIT data | Trunk shielding issue | Check trunk cable ground; verify star ground |\n| Unstable ERT voltages | Poor soil contact | Pre-moisten hole; apply saline gel |\n| Zone Hub not detected | Trunk disconnected | Inspect DB25 pins; reseat Trunk Cable |\n| Inconsistent repeats | Thermal drift | Allow 15 min warmup; check Hub fans |\n\n: Common symptoms, causes, and solutions {#tbl-quick-reference}\n\n### Diagnostic Decision Tree {#sec-decision-tree}\n\nThe following decision tree provides a systematic approach to diagnosing HIRT system issues, from initial symptom identification through resolution.\n\n\n\n## MIT Troubleshooting {#sec-mit-troubleshooting}\n\n### RX Saturation on Nearby Probes {#sec-rx-saturation}\n\n**Symptoms:** Amplitude readings maxed out on nearby probes, phase readings erratic or stuck, effects only visible on probes close to TX.\n\n**Causes:** TX output too high for close-range measurements, direct magnetic coupling between TX and RX coils, insufficient separation or poor coil orientation.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. **Reduce TX level:** Lower DDS output or TX driver gain\n2. **Increase separation:** Use wider probe spacing for close pairs\n3. **Rotate coils:** Ensure TX and RX coils are orthogonal\n4. **Add attenuation:** Use lower gain on RX for nearby probes\n5. **Skip close pairs:** Do not measure TX to RX pairs less than 0.5 m apart\n\n### Noisy MIT Data {#sec-noisy-mit}\n\n**Symptoms:** High noise floor, erratic amplitude/phase readings, inconsistent measurements between sweeps.\n\n**Causes:** Poor cable shielding, ground loops (multiple ground paths), electromagnetic interference from nearby sources, insufficient integration time.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. **Check shielding:** Verify all cables are properly shielded\n2. **Single-point ground:** Ensure only one ground connection at Hub\n3. **Twist pairs:** Use twisted-pair cables for signal lines\n4. **Increase integration:** Longer measurement time reduces noise\n5. **Check for interference sources:** Move away from power lines, vehicles, radios\n6. **Verify connections:** Check all connectors are tight and clean\n\n### No Depth Sensitivity (MIT) {#sec-no-depth-mit}\n\n**Symptoms:** Measurements do not change with depth, all readings similar regardless of target depth, no response to known deep targets.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. **Lower frequencies:** Use 2-5 kHz for MIT (deeper penetration)\n2. **Add longer offsets:** Include TX to RX pairs with >3 m spacing\n3. **Deeper probes:** Insert probes deeper if possible\n4. **Check targets:** Verify expected target depths are realistic for configuration\n\n## ERT Troubleshooting {#sec-ert-troubleshooting}\n\n### Unstable ERT Voltages {#sec-unstable-ert}\n\n**Symptoms:** Voltage readings drift or jump, inconsistent measurements, poor contact indicated in diagnostic output.\n\n**Causes:** Dry soil preventing good electrical contact, poor ring-to-soil contact, loose connections, polarization effects at electrodes.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. **Pre-moisten hole:** Add water to improve contact\n2. **Use saline gel:** Apply conductive gel around rings\n3. **Check ring contact:** Ensure rings are flush with soil\n4. **Reverse polarity:** Use AC or periodic polarity reversal to reduce polarization\n5. **Check connections:** Verify all wiring is secure\n6. **Increase current:** Slightly higher current may improve SNR\n\n### ERT Contact Problems {#sec-ert-contact}\n\n**Symptoms:** High contact resistance, erratic voltage readings, some electrodes not responding.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. Verify ring contact with soil\n2. Add water around probe (improve contact)\n3. Check ring-to-cable connection\n4. Clean rings if accessible\n5. Consider relocating probe if contact remains poor\n\n### No Depth Sensitivity (ERT) {#sec-no-depth-ert}\n\n**Symptoms:** All measurements show surface effects only, no response to known deep features, uniform readings across array.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. **Longer ERT baselines:** Corner-to-corner, edge-to-edge injections\n2. **Deeper probes:** Insert probes deeper if possible\n3. **Wider spacing:** Increase array dimensions\n\n\n\n## Power Issues {#sec-power-issues}\n\n### Probe Not Responding {#sec-probe-not-responding}\n\n**Symptoms:** No LED indicator, no communication with base hub, probe not detected in diagnostic scan.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. Check cable connections (both ends)\n2. Test with multimeter (continuity)\n3. Try different port on base hub\n4. Swap to spare cable\n5. Restart probe (disconnect/reconnect power)\n6. Replace with spare probe if available\n\n### Base Hub Not Powering On {#sec-hub-not-powering}\n\n**Symptoms:** No power LED, no response to power switch, system completely dead.\n\n**Causes:** Depleted battery, blown fuse, power switch failure.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. Check battery voltage (should be >12.0 V)\n2. Check fuse (replace if blown)\n3. Verify power switch operation\n4. Check internal connections if accessible\n5. Use backup power supply if available\n\n## Communication Issues {#sec-communication-issues}\n\n### Lost Probe Communication {#sec-lost-communication}\n\n**Symptoms:** Probe was working, now unresponsive; intermittent connection; partial data received.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. Check cable connections (both ends)\n2. Inspect cable for damage (kinks, cuts)\n3. Clean connectors with contact cleaner\n4. Swap to known-good cable\n5. Check for interference sources nearby\n6. Restart probe and base hub\n\n### Sync Problems {#sec-sync-problems}\n\n**Symptoms:** Timing errors in data, inconsistent measurements between probes, data corruption.\n\n**Causes:** Timebase distribution failure, clock drift, cable issues on sync line.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. Verify sync signal at each probe\n2. Check sync cable for damage\n3. Restart measurement system\n4. Re-initialize sync before continuing\n\n## Environmental Factors {#sec-environmental-factors}\n\n### Temperature Effects {#sec-temperature-effects}\n\n**Symptoms:** Readings drift over time, morning vs. afternoon differences, inconsistent calibration.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. Allow system to stabilize (10-15 min warmup)\n2. Note temperature variations in field log\n3. Apply temperature compensation if available\n4. Take baseline measurements at current temperature\n5. Shield equipment from direct sun if possible\n\n### Weather Impacts {#sec-weather-impacts}\n\n**Symptoms:** Data quality degradation, increased noise, contact problems.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. Protect connections from moisture\n2. Secure cables against wind movement\n3. Use weather covers for sensitive equipment\n4. Postpone measurements in severe conditions\n\n## Field Repairs {#sec-field-repairs}\n\n### Field Repair Kit {#sec-repair-kit}\n\nKeep these items handy for field repairs:\n\n- Spare cables (2-3)\n- Spare probes (2-4 recommended)\n- Electrical tape\n- Multimeter\n- Small screwdriver set\n- Contact cleaner spray\n- Zip ties\n- Heat-shrink tubing\n- Solder and iron (battery powered, optional)\n- Notebook and pencil (for notes)\n- Calibration sheet\n\n### Emergency Cable Repair {#sec-emergency-cable-repair}\n\nIf a cable is damaged in the field:\n\n1. **Locate the break** (continuity test)\n2. **Cut out damaged section** if possible\n3. **Strip and splice** wires\n4. **Insulate with tape** or heat-shrink\n5. **Test before use**\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nField-repaired cables should be replaced at first opportunity.\n:::\n\n### Connector Cleaning {#sec-connector-cleaning}\n\n1.
